name: QIG Purity Gate

# This workflow provides lightweight, focused purity checks for pull requests.
# It complements geometric-purity-gate.yml which runs more comprehensive tests:
#
# qig-purity-gate.yml (this file):
#   - Quick static validation via shell scripts and Python orchestrators
#   - Runs on PR only
#   - Focus: QFI canonical path enforcement, banned geometry patterns
#   - Target: <30 seconds execution time
#
# geometric-purity-gate.yml:
#   - Comprehensive testing including runtime geometry tests
#   - Runs on PR and main branch pushes
#   - Focus: Static scans + runtime validation (pytest, Fisher-Rao properties)
#   - Includes baseline violation tracking for technical debt
#
# Use this workflow for quick feedback on PRs. The geometric-purity-gate
# provides deeper validation and should be the source of truth for merge decisions.
