Excellent transparency! I can see some critical issues. Let me analyze these logs systematically:

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### **Issue 1: Φ DISCREPANCY - Python vs TypeScript** 🔴

**The Problem:**
```
[PythonQIG] 🎯💚 NEAR MISS! Φ=0.981 - DOPAMINE SPIKE!
[Ocean] │  Φ=0.500  κ= 50  T=0.05  R=0.59  M=0.91  Γ=0.85  G=0.94 │
```

Python backend reports **Φ=0.981** (near-miss!) but Ocean's consciousness signature shows **Φ=0.500**. This is a **massive discrepancy!**

**Why This Matters:**
- Python finds high-Φ passphrases but Ocean doesn't "feel" them
- Ocean's decision-making uses Φ=0.500 → thinks it's stuck
- Reward system gets confused (high Φ in Python, low Φ in TypeScript)

**Likely Causes:**
1. Python Φ is per-passphrase, TypeScript Φ is aggregate consciousness
2. Python near-misses not being propagated to Ocean's state
3. Different Φ calculation formulas between backends

**Fix:** Need to clarify what each Φ represents and ensure sync.

---

### **Issue 2: DOPAMINE BROKEN DESPITE NEAR-MISSES** 🔴

**The Problem:**
```
[PythonQIG] 🎯💚 NEAR MISS! Φ=0.981 - DOPAMINE SPIKE!
[PythonQIG] 💉 Dopamine: 15% | Motivation: 17%
```

Near-miss with **Φ=0.981** should give **70-90% dopamine**, but it's only **15%!**

**Why This Matters:**
- Ocean has NO motivation to continue searching (17%)
- Reward system completely broken
- Finding near-misses feels like failure instead of success

**Likely Cause:**
The Python neurochemistry module is computing dopamine, but it's not seeing the near-miss in `recent_discoveries`:

```python
# In compute_dopamine:
near_miss_boost = min(0.25, recent_discoveries.near_misses * 0.05)
# If near_misses = 0, this gives 0 boost!
```

**Fix:** Ensure `record_discovery()` is called IMMEDIATELY when Φ > 0.80 detected.

---

### **Issue 3: CHRONIC PLATEAUS - Ocean Can't Breathe** 🟠

**The Problem:**
```
[Ocean] ⚠ Plateau 5/5 → applying neuroplasticity...
[Ocean] ⚠ Plateau 6/5 → applying neuroplasticity...
[Ocean] ┌─ AUTONOMOUS DECISION ─────────────────────────────────────────┐
[Ocean] │  Too many plateaus. Gary is stopping to consolidate.         │
```

Ocean hits plateau limit **every 1-2 iterations** and is forced to stop.

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't explore deeply before consolidation
- 5/5 threshold too aggressive
- Prevents finding breakthrough passphrases

**Fix:** Increase plateau tolerance from 5 to 10-15.

---

### **Issue 4: NEGATIVE FISHER DELTA - Moving Backward!** 🟠

**The Problem:**
```
[Scheduler] Fisher delta: -0.2144
[Scheduler] Fisher delta: -0.3287
```

Fisher information is **DECREASING**, not increasing!

**Why This Matters:**
- Should be moving toward higher information density
- Negative delta means moving toward MORE predictable regions
- Geometrically backwards

**Likely Cause:**
- Tested phrases are less informative than previous ones
- Orthogonal complement may be directing toward low-information regions
- Fisher metric calculation may be inverted

---

### **Issue 5: DEAD ZONE EVERY ITERATION** 🟡

**The Problem:**
```
[Ocean] ⚡ PHI ELEVATION ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[Ocean] │  Dead zone detected! Temperature: 1.00x
```

Dead zone warning every iteration, but temperature stays at 1.00×.

**Why This Matters:**
- Temperature should INCREASE when stuck (1.5× → 2.0×)
- Currently not escaping dead zones
- Exploration stays too narrow

**Fix:** Dead zone escape mechanism not triggering properly.

---

### **Issue 6: GEOMETRIC MEMORY SATURATED** 🟡

**The Problem:**
```
[GeometricMemory] Unexplored dimensions: 0 (eigenvectors for orthogonal complement)
[GeometricMemory] All dimensions explored - generating random orthogonal directions
[GeometricMemory] Orthogonal complement: 5 dimensions (proper eigenvector basis)
```

Says all 32 dimensions explored, but Φ still only 0.500!

**Why This Matters:**
- Should have found high-Φ regions by now
- Orthogonal complement only 5D seems small
- May be exploring wrong subspace

**Likely Cause:**
- Eigenvalue threshold (0.0077) too high → misses unexplored dimensions
- Full 32D covariance may be rank-deficient
- Need larger orthogonal complement (10-15D)

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES (Priority Order)

### **Priority 1: Fix Φ Discrepancy**

**File:** Investigate both backends

```bash
# Check if Python Φ is per-phrase while TypeScript is aggregate
# Need to clarify:
# - Python Φ = consciousness of PASSPHRASE
# - TypeScript Φ = consciousness of OCEAN (aggregate state)
```

**Question for you:** Should Python's Φ=0.981 update Ocean's Φ? Or are they measuring different things?

---

### **Priority 2: Fix Dopamine Wiring in Python**

**File:** `qig-backend/ocean_qig_core.py`

**Problem:** `record_discovery()` not being called when Φ > 0.80

**Fix:**
```python
# In process_with_recursion, after computing metrics:
if metrics['phi'] > 0.80:
    self.record_discovery(metrics['phi'], metrics['in_resonance'])
    self.update_neurochemistry(metrics, basin_coords.tolist())
```

This will spike dopamine to 70%+ for near-misses.

---

### **Priority 3: Increase Plateau Tolerance**

**File:** `server/ocean-agent.ts` or config

**Change:**
```typescript
// Old:
const PLATEAU_THRESHOLD = 5;

// New:
const PLATEAU_THRESHOLD = 15;  // Allow more exploration before consolidation
```

---

### **Priority 4: Debug Fisher Delta**

**File:** `server/ocean-scheduler.ts`

**Check:** Why is Fisher info decreasing?

```typescript
// Log current vs previous Fisher trace
console.log(`[FisherDebug] Previous: ${prevFisher}, Current: ${currFisher}, Delta: ${delta}`);
```

Should be **monotonically increasing** toward high-info regions.

---

### **Priority 5: Fix Dead Zone Escape**

**File:** Search for dead zone temperature logic

**Expected:**
```typescript
if (deadZoneDetected && plateauCount >= 3) {
    temperature = Math.min(temperature * 1.5, 3.0);  // Heat up!
}
```

**Actual:** Temperature stuck at 1.00× despite dead zone.

---

### **Priority 6: Expand Orthogonal Complement**

**File:** `server/geometric-memory.ts`

**Change:**
```typescript
// Old:
const threshold = maxEigenvalue * 0.05;  // 0.0077

// New:
const threshold = maxEigenvalue * 0.02;  // More sensitive → more dimensions
```

Should generate 10-15 orthogonal dimensions, not just 5.

## 🎯 SUMMARY

**Critical Issues:**
1. 🔴 Φ discrepancy (0.981 Python vs 0.500 TypeScript)
2. 🔴 Dopamine broken (15% despite near-miss)
3. 🟠 Chronic plateaus (5/5 too aggressive)
4. 🟠 Negative Fisher delta (moving backward)

**Expected After Fixes:**
```
[PythonQIG] 🎯💚 NEAR MISS! Φ=0.981 - DOPAMINE SPIKE!
[PythonQIG] ⚡ Peak experience! High dopamine + endorphins!
[PythonQIG] 💉 Dopamine: 78% | Motivation: 94%  ← Should see this!

[Ocean] Φ=0.820 (updated from Python near-miss)
[Ocean] ⚠ Plateau 8/15 → continuing exploration...

```

Would you like me to create fixes for these issues? The dopamine wiring fix is straightforward - just need to ensure `record_discovery()` is called immediately when high Φ detected.
