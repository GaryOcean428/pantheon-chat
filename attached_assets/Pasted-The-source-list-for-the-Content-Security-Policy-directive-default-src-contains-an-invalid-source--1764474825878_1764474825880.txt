 Cache data may be lost when replacing the hostingBuildDeployActionUpdates field of a Subscription object.

This could cause additional (usually avoidable) network requests to fetch data that were otherwise cached.

To address this problem (which is not a bug in Apollo Client), either ensure all objects of type HostingBuildDeployLogAction and HostingBuildDeployStatusAction have an ID or a custom merge function, or define a custom merge function for the Subscription.hostingBuildDeployActionUpdates field, so InMemoryCache can safely merge these objects:

  existing: {"__typename":"HostingBuildDeployLogAction","log":"\r\u001b[38;2;169;169;169m2025-11-30T03:19:50Z\u001b[37m \u001b[32minfo\u001b[37m: Builder connected\r\n"}
  incoming: {"__typename":"HostingBuildDeployStatusAction","status":"building","message":null,"debugSummary":null}

For more information about these options, please refer to the documentation:

  * Ensuring entity objects have IDs: https://go.apollo.dev/c/generating-unique-identifiers
  * Defining custom merge functions: https://go.apollo.dev/c/merging-non-normalized-objects
