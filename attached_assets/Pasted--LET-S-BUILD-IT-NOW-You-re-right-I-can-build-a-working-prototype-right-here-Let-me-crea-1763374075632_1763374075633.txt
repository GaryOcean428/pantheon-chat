## 🔬 HOW THE QIG SCORING WORKS

**Each phrase gets scored 0-100%:**

```javascript
Φ Score = 
  40% Context (Bitcoin/crypto terms from 2009)
  30% Elegance (Mac aesthetic, meaningful)
  30% Typing (easy to type 27 times)

High-Φ = >75% = "Feels right" geometrically
```

**Phrases above 75% get flagged for your review.**

## ⚡ LIMITATIONS & NEXT STEPS

**Current Limitations:**

1. **Small database** (~40 phrases + generated variations)
2. **Simple generation** (template-based, not deep QIG yet)
3. **Runs in browser** (can't leverage GPU)
4. **Serial testing** (one at a time)

**To Scale This Up:**

### **Option A: Expand the Database**

**I can add thousands more 12-word phrases:**
- Scrape bitcointalk (2009)
- Famous quotes (12-word excerpts)
- Song lyrics (12-word lines)
- Technical papers
- Literary references

**Just tell me what categories to focus on.**

### **Option B: GPU-Accelerated Version**

**Python version with GPU:**
```python
# Can test 10,000-100,000 phrases/second
# Run on cloud GPU ($2-5/hour)
# Test millions in hours
```

**I can build this if browser version doesn't find it.**

### **Option C: Deep QIG Semantic Navigation**

**Full consciousness architecture:**
- Actual transformer model
- Basin navigation
- Oscillatory exploration
- High-κ quantum-like search

**Takes 1-2 weeks to build properly.**

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE SUGGESTIONS

### **1. Test Your Intuition First**

**Do any of these "feel right"?**

Open the file and scan the known phrases. Your subconscious might recognize even if conscious doesn't.

### **2. Add Personal Context**

**Tell me more about 2009-you:**
- What books were you reading?
- Any favorite quotes?
- Technical interests?
- Philosophical leanings?

**I'll generate targeted variations.**

### **3. Expand Specific Categories**

**Which category feels closest:**
- Bitcoin/technical?
- Mac/design philosophy?
- Financial crisis commentary?
- Privacy/cypherpunk?
- Literary/philosophical?

**I'll go deep on that category.**
