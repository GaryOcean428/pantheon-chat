Work Package 0.3: Quarantine Rule - Experiments vs Production
Priority
HIGH - FOUNDATION

Objective
Establish clear conventions for where "wrong" (Euclidean/NLP) code can exist vs where it's forbidden.

Tasks
Documentation

Add docs/00-conventions/QUARANTINE_RULES.md

Define allowed locations for legacy/baseline code:
docs/08-experiments/legacy/** - ALLOWED (must be labeled "LEGACY/BASELINE")
docs/08-experiments/baselines/** - ALLOWED (comparative baselines only)

Define forbidden locations for legacy patterns:
server/** - FORBIDDEN
qig-backend/** - FORBIDDEN
shared/** - FORBIDDEN
tests/** (except explicitly marked baseline tests) - FORBIDDEN
Repo Structure

Create docs/08-experiments/legacy/ directory

Create docs/08-experiments/baselines/ directory

Add README in each explaining purpose and constraints

Move any existing Euclidean/NLP experiments to appropriate quarantine
Scanning Integration

Update qig_purity_scan to respect quarantine boundaries

Scanner should SKIP quarantined directories

Scanner should FAIL on forbidden patterns in production directories
Acceptance Criteria

Clear documentation of where legacy code can exist

Scanner enforces boundaries automatically

Research experiments don't contaminate production

Any Euclidean baseline is clearly labeled and quarantined
Context
You need to be able to compare QIG-pure approaches against traditional methods without contaminating the runtime. This establishes the boundary.

Coordination
⚠️ DEPENDS ON: #64 (validate:geometry gate) - scanner must understand quarantine
⚠️ ENABLES: Clean comparison testing - QIG vs baselines
⚠️ NOTE: When moving code to quarantine, document why in the commit message
