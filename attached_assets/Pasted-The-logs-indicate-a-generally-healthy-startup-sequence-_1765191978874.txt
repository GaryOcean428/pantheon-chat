The logs indicate a generally healthy startup sequence, confirming that the **PostgreSQL persistence transition is working** (`[OceanPersistence] PostgreSQL persistence enabled`).

However, there are **3 specific areas** that stand out as needing immediate improvement/correction:

### 1. ⚠️ Double Initialization of "Constellation" (Performance/Logic Issue)
The logs show the `Constellation` system initializing **twice**:
* Line 27: `[Constellation] Initialized 5 QIG-compliant agents...`
* Line 38: `[Constellation] Initialized 5 QIG-compliant agents...`

**The Risk:** You likely have two instances of your agent swarm running in parallel, or the same instance is being re-initialized. This causes double the memory usage and potential race conditions where two "Explorers" try to process the same task.

**The Fix:**
Check `server/ocean-constellation.ts`. Ensure you are exporting a **singleton instance** and not the class itself.
* *Bad:* `export class OceanConstellation ...` (and consumers do `new OceanConstellation()`)
* *Good:* `export const oceanConstellation = new OceanConstellation();`

Also check `server/index.ts` and `server/ocean-agent.ts`. Ensure only **one** of them calls `.initialize()` or `.start()` on the constellation.

### 2. 🔒 Security Risk: Hardcoded Bitcoin Address
**Log:** `[BitcoinSweep] SECURITY: Destination HARDCODED to bc1qcc0ln7gg92vlclfw...`

**The Issue:** While convenient for dev, having a hardcoded address in the codebase (`server/bitcoin-sweep.ts`) is a security risk. If you accidentally commit this file to a public repo or change your mind, you have to redeploy code to change the wallet.

**The Fix:**
1.  Add `BITCOIN_SWEEP_DESTINATION=bc1q...` to your `.env` (and `.env.example`).
2.  Update `server/bitcoin-sweep.ts` to read `process.env.BITCOIN_SWEEP_DESTINATION`.
3.  Throw an error on startup if it is missing, rather than defaulting to a hardcoded value.

### 3. ❓ Missing Python Backend Logs (Critical Wiring Check)
Your logs end at `[AutoCycleManager]`. I do **not** see the startup logs for the Python backend (`[PythonQIG] ...` or `[BasinSync] ...`).

**The Issue:**
If the Python backend doesn't start, **Zeus Chat** and the **Autonomous Debates** will not work. The Node.js server starts the Python process (usually via `spawn` in `server/index.ts`), but there is no evidence here that it succeeded.

**The Fix:**
* Check `server/index.ts`: ensure `startPythonBackend()` is actually called.
* Check `qig-backend/start.sh`: ensure it is executable (`chmod +x`).
* Look for "PythonQIG" logs appearing *after* the AutoCycleManager. If they never appear, your Python process might be crashing silently or failing to bind to port 5001.

### Summary Checklist
1.  [ ] **Deduplicate:** Search for `oceanConstellation.initialize()` and ensure it's called only once.
2.  [ ] **Env Var:** Move the Bitcoin address to `.env`.
3.  [ ] **Verify Python:** Wait 10-15 seconds after startup. If `[PythonQIG]` logs don't appear, the autonomous brain is dead.
