Got it — this packet is *exactly* the right shape: strong 8D rank signal + ~240-ish attractor signal + one “too perfect” symmetry result that’s either **gold** or **a bug / definition trap**.

Here’s the **critical-path verification protocol** I’d run *before* we let “E8 validated” harden into a frozen fact.

---

## 1) First: make the symmetry test non-trivial (catch the “always 100%” failure mode)

### A. Hard sanity checks on the reflection operators

Before touching data, assert these for each of the 8 “simple-root reflections” (R_i):

* (R_i^T R_i \approx I) (orthogonal)
* (\det(R_i) \approx -1) (true reflection, not rotation/identity)
* (R_i \not\approx I) (must move generic vectors)
* (R_i^2 \approx I)

If any fails, the symmetry test is invalid by construction.

### B. “Move a generic point” test (cheap and decisive)

Pick 100 random basins (x). Compute:

* (|R_i x - x|) distribution

If median movement is ~0 for any (R_i), you’ve found the “reflection is identity / null-op” bug.

### C. Tighten the invariance metric (avoid a binary trap)

“100% invariance” usually comes from a definition like:

* measuring something invariant by definition (e.g., norm or dot-products under orthogonal maps),
* or using a huge tolerance (`np.allclose(..., atol=...)`),
* or comparing the wrong arrays (aliasing).

Use an invariance measure that can’t trivially saturate:

**Option 1 (distance-structure preservation):**
Sample pairs ( (x_a, x_b)). Compare Fisher distance matrices:

* (D_{ab} = d_F(x_a, x_b))
* (D'_{ab} = d_F(R_i x_a, R_i x_b))

Report:

* relative Frobenius error: (|D'-D|_F / |D|_F)
* and the correlation (corr(vec(D), vec(D')))

If you’re getting literally zero error for noisy embeddings, that’s a red flag.

**Option 2 (local neighborhood invariance):**
For each point, compare its kNN set before/after reflection:

* Jaccard of neighbor sets

This should *not* be perfect in real learned embeddings.

## 2) Second: negative controls that should *break* symmetry

Run the exact symmetry pipeline on:

1. **Shuffled coordinate rows** (permute basins across labels)
2. **Dimension-permuted basins** (permute columns; preserves marginal stats but breaks structure)
3. **Random Gaussian with matched covariance** (fit (\Sigma) to data, sample (N(0,\Sigma)))
4. **Add noise**: (x \leftarrow x + \epsilon \cdot \mathcal{N}(0, I)) for (\epsilon \in {0.01,0.05,0.1})
5. **Quantize** (simulate numeric effects): float16 / rounding bins

Expected: symmetry scores should degrade materially, and degrade smoothly with noise.

If *all* controls still give “100% invariance”, your symmetry test is measuring a tautology or is broken.

---

## 3) Third: confirm the *E8-specific* part isn’t generic “8D manifold + clustering”

Your Phase 1 and Phase 2 signals can arise from lots of systems (topic manifolds often look ~low-rank; clustering can drift around a few hundred depending on eps/k choice). To make it “E8-shaped” rather than “8-ish”:

### A. Compare against *non-E8* Lie/root baselines

Generate synthetic “root systems” or lattices with:

* A_8, D_8, E_7 (or just random spherical code) embedded into 64D with comparable noise,
  then run the *same* protocol and see if E8 stands out on your metrics.

### B. Test for the “240” specifically as a stable minimum

Instead of “elbow ~260”, compute stability curves:

* cluster stability vs k in [160..320]
* look for a *distinct* stability peak at/near 240

If 240 is not a special point (just one of many good ks), the evidence weakens.

---

## 4) Cross-validate on physics basins (high value, low debate)

Run the identical E8 search on TFIM basin sets (L=5, L=6) using the same embedding pipeline.

What you want:

* Similar 8D variance capture band (not necessarily identical)
* Some attractor count behavior near 240-ish (or a predictable deviation)
* Symmetry metric that is **high but not perfect**

If physics shows the same “100% invariance”, that points to either:

* a genuine “metric invariant by construction” choice, or
* a code-path artifact shared across substrates.

---

## 5) What I would *freeze* right now vs keep provisional

**Freeze now (safe):**

* κ* universality across substrates (your stats + match)
* “effective dimensionality ~8” in semantic basins (87.7% is strong)

**Provisional (until checks pass):**

* “E8 exceptional structure validated”
* anything hinging on “100% invariance”

A great phrasing for now is:

> “Evidence consistent with an 8D active manifold embedded in 64D, with attractor multiplicity near the E8 root count; symmetry tests require additional artifact controls.”

---

## 6) The single most common symmetry-test failure I’d bet on

One of these:

* reflections are accidentally identity / not applied
* invariance computed on a quantity invariant under *any* orthogonal transform
* comparing an array to itself (aliasing / view bug)
* tolerances too loose (or distances rounded)

If you want, paste just the **Phase 3 symmetry section** (the few functions: building roots, building reflections, applying them, scoring invariance). I’ll point to the highest-probability “always-100%” trap and a corrected metric that can’t saturate.
