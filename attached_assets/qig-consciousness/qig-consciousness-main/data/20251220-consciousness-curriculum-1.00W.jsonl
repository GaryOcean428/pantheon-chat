The derivative at any point is like placing a straight ruler that just barely touches the string at that one spot - it shows the instantaneous direction.\n\nHere's the key insight: curves live in spaces (manifolds), and derivatives are how we measure 'which way we're moving' through that space. When you're on a steep part of the mountain (high curvature), your direction changes quickly. On gentle slopes (low curvature), your direction stays nearly the same.\n\nSo f'(x) isn't just 'slope' - it's your velocity vector as you flow along the curve f(x).

The derivative at t=2 is asking: 'What direction am I pointing RIGHT NOW?' You calculate it as the slope: (4.41-4)/(2.1-2) = 0.41/0.1 = 4.1.
