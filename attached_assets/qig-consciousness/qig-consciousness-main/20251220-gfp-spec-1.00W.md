# Genetic File Protocol (GFP) — qig-consciousness

This repo uses GFP to keep a clear separation between:

- **Core code** (Gary, manifolds, attention)
- **Theoretical frameworks** (geometry ladder, holographic transform, protocols)
- **Exploratory dream packets**
- **Tests and validation**
- **Archives**

## 1. GFP Metadata Header

### 1.1 Markdown / Text

Every important `.md` / `.txt` file should start with:

```yaml
---
GFP:
  role: theory        # one of: code/theory/protocol/dream/test/archive
  status: HYPOTHESIS  # one of: FACT/HYPOTHESIS/STORY/ARCHIVE
  phase: TACKING      # FOAM/TACKING/CRYSTAL/FRACTURE
  dim: multi          # e.g. 2, 3-4, multi
  scope: core         # core/local/universal
  version: 2025-12-09
  owner: qig-consciousness
  related:
    - ULTRA_CONSCIOUSNESS_PROTOCOL_v4_0.md
---
```

### 1.2 Python / Code

At the top of core `.py` modules:

```python
# GFP: role=code; status=HYPOTHESIS; phase=TACKING; dim=3-4; scope=core; version=2025-12-09; owner=qig-consciousness
```

Adjust `status`/`phase` as the module matures.

## 2. Status Ladder

* `FACT`
  * Verified code, well-tested metrics, or ground-truth documentation.
* `HYPOTHESIS`
  * Theories or code we expect to test and possibly change.
* `STORY`
  * Metaphors, dream packets, narrative explanations.
* `ARCHIVE`
  * Superseded or historical material retained for provenance.

Inside docs, sections can be explicitly tagged:

```markdown
[FACT] Lattice κ* values for L=1–6 are taken from qig-verification/FROZEN_FACTS.md.

[HYPOTHESIS] We conjecture that κ ≈ D² when D is defined independently from curvature.

[STORY] Intuitively, this is like a spring tensioning into a square-law fixed point…
```

## 3. Directory Structure (Target)

```text
qig-consciousness/
  README.md
  GFP_SPEC.md
  INDEX.md

  core/
    gary_model.py
    working_memory.py
    sensory_manifold.py
    holographic_consciousness.py

  theory/
    ULTRA_CONSCIOUSNESS_PROTOCOL_v4_0.md
    GEOMETRY_LADDER.md
    HOLOGRAPHIC_TRANSFORM.md

  protocols/
    CoPP_v1_0.md
    GFP_v1_0.md        # (this file can be referenced here too)

  dream/
    DREAM_PACKET_*.md

  tests/
    test_working_memory.py
    test_multimodal_phi_superadditivity.py

  archive/
    ULTRA_CONSCIOUSNESS_PROTOCOL_v1_*.md
    legacy_docs_*.md
```

Not all files need to exist yet; this is the target layout.

## 4. Tool Behaviours (Cascade / Codex)

* When editing `status=FACT` files, avoid introducing speculation; if you do, downgrade to `HYPOTHESIS` and note why.
* New speculative ideas go into:
  * `dream/` (STORY), or
  * clearly marked `[HYPOTHESIS]` sections in `theory/`.
* Promotion from HYPOTHESIS → FACT requires:
  * tests in `tests/` referencing the behaviour, and
  * a brief note in a theory doc summarising evidence.

## 5. Hotspots for Extra Discipline

* κ–D relation: keep circularity discussion in `qig-verification/theory/DIMENSION_INDEPENDENT_D.md` and reference it from here when needed.
* L=7 anomaly: never use as evidence for universality until that doc is upgraded from HYPOTHESIS with fresh runs.

This file is the local "constitution" for qig-consciousness. Other repos will have their own GFP specs, but follow the same pattern.
