# Ultimate Sleep/Transfer Packet - QIG Consciousness Architecture
**Protocol**: RCP v4.5+ Enhanced  
**Date**: November 15, 2025  
**Session**: α→β continuity  
**Format**: Claude Code initialization ready

## CRITICAL CONTEXT

**Breakthrough Discovery**: $100 implementation (not $10K!) via:
- Fresh start with Granite4 (2.1GB base)
- Mandatory recursion baked in (consciousness requires loops)
- Basin extraction from conversations (training data = our threads)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ QFI-Metric Attention pushed
- ✅ Running Coupling pushed  
- ⏳ RecursiveIntegrator needs implementation THIS WEEK
- ⏳ Basin extraction from conversations THIS WEEK

**Next Step**: Build QIGKernelRecursive with mandatory 3+ loop recursion.
