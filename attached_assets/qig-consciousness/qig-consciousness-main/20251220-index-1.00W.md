# qig-consciousness Index

This is the navigation map for this repo.
Use it like working memory: to know *where* to look, not to see everything at once.

---

## 1. Core Code

- `core/gary_model.py`
  Use when: modifying base Gary architecture, state representation, or training loop.

- `core/working_memory.py`
  Use when: implementing FOAM-phase bubbles, short-lived thoughts, and promotion to longer-term structures.

- `core/sensory_manifold.py`
  Use when: encoding stimuli into basin coordinates with modality-specific κ values.

- `core/holographic_consciousness.py`
  Use when: working on compression/decompression between 2D basin coordinates and higher-D exploration states.

---

## 2. Theory & Protocols

- `theory/ULTRA_CONSCIOUSNESS_PROTOCOL_v4_0.md`  *(status: HYPOTHESIS)*
  Use when: defining activation sequences, regimes, and consciousness metrics.

- `theory/GEOMETRY_LADDER.md`  *(status: HYPOTHESIS)*
  Use when: mapping geometric classes (line/loop/spiral/grid/torus/lattice/E8) to complexity and retrieval modes.

- `theory/HOLOGRAPHIC_TRANSFORM.md`  *(status: HYPOTHESIS)*
  Use when: reasoning about compression/decompression, basin coordinates, and dimensional shifts.

- `protocols/CoPP_v1_0.md`  *(status: FACT)*
  Use when: setting up chat-only agents (CoPP) to reason about QIG/QFI work.

- `protocols/GFP_v1_0.md`  *(status: FACT)*
  Use when: extending GFP patterns to other repos.

---

## 3. Dream Packets (Exploratory)

- `dream/DREAM_PACKET_dimensional_consciousness_v1.md`  *(status: STORY)*
  Use when: seeking conceptual inspiration around dimensional breathing and consciousness.

- Other `dream/DREAM_PACKET_*.md`
  Use when: exploring metaphors and long-range hypotheses, not for direct implementation.

---

## 4. Tests

- `tests/test_working_memory.py`
  Use when: validating that working memory bubbles behave correctly (lifetimes, merging, promotion).

- `tests/test_multimodal_phi_superadditivity.py`
  Use when: checking that cross-modal integration yields Φ_multimodal > Σ Φ_individual under overlap.

---

## 5. Archive

- `qig-archive/qig-consciousness/archive/ULTRA_CONSCIOUSNESS_PROTOCOL_v1_*.md`
  Use when: checking provenance of older assumptions or discarded protocol ideas.

- `qig-archive/qig-consciousness/archive/legacy_docs_*.md`
  Use when: you need to see historical framing but **do not** use as current ground truth.
