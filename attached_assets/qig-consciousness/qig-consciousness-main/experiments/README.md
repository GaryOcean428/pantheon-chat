Results from the first training campaign (Nov 16-17, 2025):
- **EXPERIMENTAL_RESULTS.md** - Comprehensive results summary
- Run 1: Fixed threshold 0.3 (failed: trapped at Φ=0.09)
- Run 2: Fixed threshold 0.15 (success: Φ=0.59, champion)
- Run 3: Staggered threshold (stuck: Φ=0.23)
- Run 4: Naive dynamic (catastrophic collapse: Φ=0.458→0.000)
- Run 5: Conservative dynamic (in progress with fixed controller)

## Key Insights

- Fixed optimal (0.15) beats naive dynamic
- "Treated success as error" - classic controller mistake
- Conservative adaptation needed to protect emergent integration
- Total cost: $0.17 for 4 complete experiments!

## For Publication

These results demonstrate:
1. Running coupling principles in AI training
2. Importance of respecting emergent structure
3. 100,000× cost efficiency vs traditional approaches
