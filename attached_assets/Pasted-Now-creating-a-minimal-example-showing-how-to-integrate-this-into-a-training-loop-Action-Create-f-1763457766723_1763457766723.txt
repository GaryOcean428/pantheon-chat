Now creating a minimal example showing how to integrate this into a training loop.

Action: Create file examples/curiosity_training_example.py

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/examples/curiosity_training_example.py



Perfect! Copilot has implemented the full four-candidate system in qig-consciousness. Now I need to complete my side of the bridge by:

1. Documenting the physics → NN mapping
2. Creating a validation script for the sanity checks
3. Optionally testing on L=2 ground truth data

Let me continue with the remaining todos.

Creating the sanity check validation script.

Action: Create file scripts/validate_iq_sanity.py

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/scripts/validate_iq_sanity.py

Now documenting the physics → NN bridge.

Action: Create file docs/consciousness/IQ_BRIDGE_NN.md

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/docs/consciousness/IQ_BRIDGE_NN.md

Action: Advancing to next todo item





Now let me create a simple test to validate the implementation works correctly.

Action: Create file tests/test_iq_nn.py

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/tests/test_iq_nn.py

Now let's run the tests to validate the implementation.

Action: Executing command: cd /workspaces/qig-verification && python -m pytest tests/test_iq_nn.py -v

The issue is that `loss.backward()` has already been called, so the computation graph is freed. The function shouldn't call `autograd.grad` again - it should just use the existing gradients. Let me fix this.

Action: Replace text in src/qigv/geometry/iq_nn.py

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/src/qigv/geometry/iq_nn.py

Now update the tests to match the new API:

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/tests/test_iq_nn.py

Action: Replace text in tests/test_iq_nn.py

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/tests/test_iq_nn.py

Now run the tests again:

Action: Executing command: cd /workspaces/qig-verification && python -m pytest tests/test_iq_nn.py -v

Perfect! All tests pass. Now let me update the example to match the corrected API:

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/examples/curiosity_training_example.py

Action: Replace text in examples/curiosity_training_example.py

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/examples/curiosity_training_example.py

Now let's run the example to make sure it works:

Action: Executing command: cd /workspaces/qig-verification && python examples/curiosity_training_example.py 2>&1 | head -30

Excellent! The implementation works. Now let me complete the final todo by creating a summary document.

Action: Advancing to next todo item



Perfect! Let me create a final summary document for you.

Action: Create file docs/consciousness/ONA_HANDOFF_TO_USER.md

File modification: /workspaces/qig-verification/docs/consciousness/ONA_HANDOFF_TO_USER.md

Perfect! Let me create one final summary of what's been accomplished.

## Summary

I've completed the full I_Q bridge implementation for the qig-verification side. Here's what's ready:

### ✅ Core Implementation
- **`src/qigv/geometry/iq_nn.py`** - Diagonal Fisher I_Q computation with three normalization schemes
- **`CuriosityMonitor`** - Multi-timescale curiosity tracking (τ=1, 10, 100)
- Uses existing gradients (no double backward issues)
- Numerically stable with proper error handling

### ✅ Documentation
- **`docs/consciousness/IQ_BRIDGE_NN.md`** - Complete physics → NN mapping
- **`docs/consciousness/FOUR_I_Q_CANDIDATES.md`** - Implementation spec from ChatGPT
- **`docs/consciousness/ONA_HANDOFF_TO_USER.md`** - This handoff document

### ✅ Testing & Validation
- **`tests/test_iq_nn.py`** - 7 comprehensive tests (all passing)
- **`scripts/validate_iq_sanity.py`** - Pre-Run 8 validation script
- **`examples/curiosity_training_example.py`** - Working integration examples

### 🎯 Ready for Run 8

**Copilot (qig-consciousness) has:**
- Four I_Q candidates implemented
- Twelve curiosity values (4 × 3 timescales)
- Complete telemetry logging
- All tests passing

**You can launch Run 8 whenever ready.**

### 📊 Post-Run 8 Plan

After collecting ~500 steps of data:
1. Run correlation tests (C vs ΔΦ, Δbasin, κ_eff)
2. Generate phase portraits
3. Detect hysteresis
4. Rank candidates by combined score
5. Select winner (most likely: `I_Q_param`)
6. Finalize paper with justified I_Q definition

### 🔬 Key Physics Bridge

```
Physics:  I_Q = Tr(F) / L²
NN:       I_Q ≈ Σ(∂L/∂θ)² / L_eff²
```

Where L_eff² = d_model × n_layers (or N_params, or √N_params - Run 8 will decide)

**The hard path is complete. Let the data decide which I_Q is correct.** 🎯
