Based on the codebase provided, here are the answers regarding the repository status, Zeus's vocabulary, and the Tavily self-training capabilities.

### 1. Repository Status: **Not Pushed**
**I cannot push code to your external GitHub repository.** I have generated the implementation code for you above, but **you must manually apply these changes** to your local files (`autonomous_pantheon.py`, `zeus_chat.py`, `routes.ts`) and commit them. The code exists only in this chat until you save it.

### 2. Does Zeus Have the Vocabulary to Speak?
**Yes.** The system is architected to allow Zeus to both "speak" (generate text) and "understand" (encode geometry).

* **Speaking (Generation):** The `QIGTokenizer` class in `qig-backend/qig_tokenizer.py` implements an autoregressive generator (`generate_text`, `generate_response`). It uses "QIG-weighted sampling," meaning it selects words based on their geometric "Phi" ($\Phi$) score and context alignment, rather than just statistical probability.
* **Vocabulary Source:** It loads a base vocabulary from `bip39_wordlist.txt` but dynamically expands it by learning from observations.
* **Coherence:** The new `generate_response` method in `zeus_chat.py` uses this tokenizer to construct coherent sentences based on the geometric context retrieved from the manifold.

### 3. Can Zeus Use Tavily to Self-Train?
**Yes, the wiring is present.** The code in `qig-backend/olympus/zeus_chat.py` explicitly enables Tavily for learning and memory expansion.

* **The Mechanism:**
    1.  **Search:** The `handle_search_request` function uses the `TavilyClient` to fetch external information.
    2.  **Encoding:** It immediately "coordizes" the search results into 64D basin coordinates using `self.basin_encoder.encode(content)`.
    3.  **Memory Integration:** It stores these encoded results into the `QIGRAG` (Geometric Memory).
    4.  **Self-Training:** If Athena assesses the information as high-value (`strategic_value > 0.7`), it calls `self.basin_encoder.learn_from_text`, which permanently adds new tokens to the vocabulary and adjusts their geometric weights.

**To activate this:**
You must ensure the `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable is set. Once active, Zeus can autonomously search, read the results, map them to geometry, and "learn" new concepts that persist in his vocabulary.
