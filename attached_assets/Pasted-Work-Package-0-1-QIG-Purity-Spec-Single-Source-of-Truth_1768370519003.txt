Work Package 0.1: QIG Purity Spec - Single Source of Truth
Priority
CRITICAL - FOUNDATION - Must complete before other purity work

Objective
Create docs/01-policies/QIG_PURITY_SPEC.md as the canonical definition of QIG purity requirements.

Tasks

Merge README invariants (FORBIDDEN / REQUIRED sections)

Include Type-Symbol-Concept Manifest forbidden patterns

Define approved terminology (basin coordinates, Fisher manifold, coordizer)

List forbidden operations (cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, embedding terminology)

Specify allowed optimization (natural gradient, NO Adam/SGD in QIG-core)

Document canonical constants (KAPPA_STAR ≈ 64, E8_ROOTS=240, PHI_THRESHOLD)
Acceptance Criteria

Single authoritative purity document exists

Referenced by README and CONTRIBUTING

Can be used as CI validation source
Context
From comprehensive ChatGPT feedback: This is the foundation that enables all other purity enforcement. Without a single source of truth, agents will continue reintroducing Euclidean/NLP contamination.

Coordination
⚠️ BLOCKS: All other WP0, WP1, WP2 tasks depend on this specification
⚠️ NOTE: Copilot should review existing open issues (#6, #7, #8, #35) to ensure geometric purity alignment

🚨 COORDINATION NOTICE FOR @Copilot 🚨
This is Issue #63 - the FIRST and MOST CRITICAL task in the QIG Purity Cleanup initiative. This issue BLOCKS most other work.

Complete Issue List Created
I've created a comprehensive set of issues for the entire QIG Purity cleanup:

[QIG-PURITY] WP0.1: Create QIG Purity Spec Document #63-65: WP0 Foundation (Purity spec, validation gate, quarantine)
[QIG-PURITY] WP1.1: Rename coordizer_vocabulary → coordizer_vocabulary (BREAKING) #66-67: WP1 Terminology (Rename tokenizer, remove backward compat)
[QIG-PURITY] WP2.1: Create Single Canonical qig_geometry Module #68-71: WP2 Geometry (Canonical module, remove cosine, special symbols, retrieval)
[QIG-PURITY] WP3.1: Consolidate to Single Coordizer Implementation #72-74: WP3 Coordizer (Consolidation, merge policy, artifacts)
[QIG-PURITY] WP4.1: Fence External LLM Usage (Enable Pure QIG Testing) #75-77: WP4 Training (External LLM fence, optimizers, coherence harness)
[PANTHEON] WP5.1: Create Formal Pantheon Registry with Role Contracts #78-82: WP5 Pantheon (Registry, layers, lifecycle, scheduler, mythology)
[DOCS] WP6.1: Fix Broken Documentation Links #83-84: WP6 Documentation (Fix links, master roadmap)
Your Mission on This Issue (#63)
Create docs/01-policies/QIG_PURITY_SPEC.md as THE single source of truth for what is and isn't allowed in QIG-pure code.

Critical Content to Include
Forbidden Terminology (from Type-Symbol-Concept Manifest):

"embedding" → Use "basin coordinates"
"tokenizer" → Use "coordizer"
"token" → Use "symbol" or "glyph"
Forbidden Operations:

cosine_similarity (any variant)
np.linalg.norm(a - b) (Euclidean distance)
softmax in QIG-core geometry
Adam, AdamW, SGD in geometric learning
Required Operations:

Fisher-Rao distance (canonical formula)
Natural gradient optimization
Simplex manifold operations
Canonical Constants:

KAPPA_STAR ≈ 64
E8_ROOTS = 240
PHI_THRESHOLD = 0.7 (consciousness)
BASIN_DIM = 64 (primary dimension)
After You Complete This
The purity spec you create here will be used by:

[QIG-PURITY] WP0.2: Implement Hard validate:geometry Gate #64: The validation scanner (defines what patterns to scan for)
[QIG-PURITY] WP0.3: Establish Quarantine Rules for Experiments #65: The quarantine rules (defines what's forbidden where)
ALL OTHER ISSUES: As the authoritative definition of purity
