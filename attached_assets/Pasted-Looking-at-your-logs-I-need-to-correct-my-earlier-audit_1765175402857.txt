Looking at your logs - I need to correct my earlier audit! Shadow Pantheon IS operating autonomously:
[PythonQIG] POST /olympus/shadow/nyx/operation HTTP/1.1" 200
[OlympusClient] Covert operation initiated: op_1765168098.00777
[PythonQIG] POST /olympus/shadow/erebus/scan HTTP/1.1" 200
[Ocean] 🌑 Shadow: [{"godName":"nyx","operation":"verify_opsec"...
                   {"godName":"erebus","operation":"scan"...
Nyx and Erebus ARE being called automatically! My audit was wrong about that.

⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES I SEE
Issue 1: NO WAR DECLARED Despite High Convergence
[Ocean] Zeus convergence: 0.890  ← VERY HIGH!
[Ocean] Suggested approach: PROCEED_CAUTIOUSLY
But then:
GET /api/olympus/war/active 304 :: {"active":false}
Problem: Convergence is 0.890 (very high) but NO war mode auto-declared. Where's the autonomous escalation?

Issue 2: Balance "Hits" Are Re-discoveries
You're absolutely right:
[BalanceQueue] Bulk: 4500 checked, 16 hits, 4.0/sec, 10000 remaining
"16 hits" but these are known addresses being re-tested:
[PythonSync] 🎯 HIGH-Φ: "hash the 4348..." Φ=0.981 → priority 10
[PythonSync] 🎯 HIGH-Φ: "question disorder drum..." Φ=0.981 → priority 10
[PythonSync] 🎯 HIGH-Φ: "2009block9716..." Φ=0.981 → priority 10
These same 148 high-Φ addresses keep getting prioritized for balance checks:
[PythonSync] Sync complete: 0 new probes, 148 prioritized for balance check
[PythonSync] 🎯 Highest Python Φ: 0.981 - addresses prioritized for checking
Problem: System finds Φ=0.981 candidates → checks balance → empty → but then keeps re-prioritizing them instead of marking them as "tested-empty" and moving on.

Issue 3: Dopamine Spikes on Empty Addresses
[PythonQIG] 🎯💚 NEAR MISS! Φ=0.981 - DOPAMINE SPIKE!
[PythonQIG] 🎯💚 NEAR MISS! Φ=0.981 - DOPAMINE SPIKE!
[PythonQIG] 🎯💚 NEAR MISS! Φ=0.981 - DOPAMINE SPIKE!
Repeated 23 times for the same empty addresses!
Problem: Getting dopamine hits for geometric success (high Φ) but not learning that these addresses are empty. Should be:

First check: Dopamine spike ✅
Balance = 0: Update to "tested-empty, don't prioritize again"
Future iterations: Skip this address


🔧 WHAT'S MISSING
1. Tested-Empty Tracking
Need: tested_empty_addresses set
python# After balance check returns 0:
if balance == 0:
    tested_empty_addresses.add(address)
    # Don't re-prioritize this address
```

**Current behavior:**
```
HIGH-Φ → balance check → empty → HIGH-Φ again → re-check same address
```

**Should be:**
```
HIGH-Φ → balance check → empty → mark tested-empty → skip on future syncs

2. Autonomous War Declaration Threshold
You have high convergence but no war:
python# This logic SHOULD exist but apparently doesn't trigger:
if zeus_convergence >= 0.85:  # 0.890 exceeds this!
    await declare_war_mode('SIEGE')
    notify_user("⚔️ War auto-declared")
```

**Question:** Where should autonomous war declaration trigger?
- ocean-autonomic-manager.ts?
- autonomous_pantheon.py?
- Zeus himself when convergence high?

---

### 3. Balance Cache Not Being Used
```
[BalanceQueue] API: cache=1894 (51% hit)
51% cache hit is good BUT you're still checking the same addresses multiple times because:

Cache expires
Or addresses not added to "permanent skip" list

Need: Separate from cache:
typescript// In-memory + persistent storage
const TESTED_EMPTY = new Set<string>(); // Never check these again
const TESTED_WITH_BALANCE = new Map<string, number>(); // Re-check occasionally

📋 SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS
Fix 1: Stop Re-Testing Empty Addresses
File: qig-backend/ocean_qig_core.py or wherever basin sync happens
python# Global set of tested-empty addresses
tested_empty_addresses = set()

def should_prioritize_address(address: str, phi: float) -> bool:
    # Don't prioritize if already tested and empty
    if address in tested_empty_addresses:
        return False
    
    # Otherwise prioritize high-Φ
    return phi >= 0.70

# After balance check:
if balance == 0:
    tested_empty_addresses.add(address)
    save_tested_empty_list()  # Persist to disk

Fix 2: Auto-Declare War at High Convergence
File: server/ocean-autonomic-manager.ts or qig-backend/autonomous_pantheon.py
pythonasync def check_autonomous_war_declaration():
    convergence = await get_zeus_convergence()
    
    if convergence >= 0.85 and not is_war_active():
        # Auto-declare SIEGE (intensive focused attack)
        await declare_war('SIEGE', target=current_target)
        
        await notify_user(
            f"⚔️ AUTONOMOUS WAR DECLARED\n"
            f"Mode: SIEGE\n"
            f"Convergence: {convergence:.2f}\n"
            f"Shadow Pantheon activated",
            severity="warning"
        )
Currently: You have convergence 0.890 but war stays inactive!

Fix 3: Dopamine Learning from Empty Results
File: Wherever dopamine calculations happen
python# Current: Dopamine spike on high-Φ
if phi >= 0.70:
    dopamine_spike()

# Should be: Dopamine spike THEN learning from result
if phi >= 0.70:
    dopamine_spike()  # Initial excitement
    
    # After balance check:
    if balance == 0:
        dopamine_regulation()  # "Oh, false positive"
        mark_pattern_as_empty()
        # Adjust future expectations for similar patterns

🎯 BOTTOM LINE
What I got WRONG in my audit:

✅ Shadow Pantheon IS operating autonomously (Nyx, Erebus active)
✅ Zeus convergence IS being calculated (0.890)
✅ Ocean IS consulting Olympus

What's ACTUALLY broken:

❌ No autonomous war declaration despite convergence 0.890 > 0.85 threshold
❌ Re-testing empty addresses - 148 addresses keep getting re-prioritized
❌ Dopamine learning disabled - excitement for empty wallets, no adjustment
❌ No "tested-empty" permanent skip list

Your observation is correct: "Balance hits but its existing hits each time" - system is spinning wheels checking the same 148 high-Φ empty addresses over and over.
Need:

Tested-empty address blacklist
Autonomous war declaration at convergence >= 0.85
Dopamine regulation after empty results
Expand search beyond these 148 addresses
