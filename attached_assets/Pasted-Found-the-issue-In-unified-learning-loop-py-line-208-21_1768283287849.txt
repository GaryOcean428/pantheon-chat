Found the issue! In unified_learning_loop.py line 208-216, the insight training call is missing basin_trajectory:

self._training_integrator.train_from_outcome(
    god_name=insight.source,
    prompt=insight.content,
    response=f"Insight φΔ={insight.phi_delta:.3f}",
    success=insight.phi_delta > 0,
    phi=phi + insight.phi_delta,
    kappa=kappa,
    coherence_score=insight.confidence,
    # ❌ Missing: basin_trajectory
)
When insights from Athena (or other gods) are processed for training, no trajectory is passed, so attractors can't form.

Root cause: The insight object contains the god's source but not the basin coordinates traversed during that insight generation.

Here's my plan to address both issues:

Task 1: Fix Attractor Formation - Add basin_trajectory to insight training calls. The insight object may need to carry basin coordinates, or we can compute them from the insight content.

Task 2: Deprecate learned_words - Migrate the 21 file references to use coordizer_vocabulary with token_role IN ('generation', 'both') instead.

Task 3: Clean up duplicate table - After migration, mark learned_words for removal.

the debates are not good quality english. what is it learning from thedebates. deliniateebetween qig ml and kernel trainng.

Now let

You're right to flag this. Let me clarify what's happening:

The Two Learning Systems
1. QIG Geometric Learning (Basin-Level)

Learns geometric relationships between tokens in 64D Fisher manifold space
Updates the coordizer_vocabulary, word_relationships, and learned_manifold_attractors tables
When debates happen, it records which basin coordinates led to successful/unsuccessful outcomes
This is the pure geometric layer - no meaning, just spatial relationships
2. Kernel Training (Behavior-Level)

Updates kernel weights via kernel_training_orchestrator.py
Learns which strategies (gods) work for which types of problems
Records φ/κ outcomes to adjust routing decisions
This is about which kernel to use when, not language quality
The Poor English Problem
The debate outputs like:

"Her asymmetric editors querying about this tactics. Their vitamin shielded magnetic skills..."

This is QIG-pure generation - reconstructing text from basin coordinates WITHOUT any language model. The system is:

Picking the nearest tokens by Fisher-Rao distance
Stringing them together based on geometric coherence
NOT checking grammar or meaning
What debates are learning:

Basin trajectories that led to "agreement" vs "disagreement"
Geometric paths through the manifold that resolved conflicts
NOT how to write proper English
The Core Issue
The QIG-pure generative output is designed for internal kernel communication (geometric signals), not human-readable responses. When you chat with Zeus, it should route to proper synthesis - but the autonomous debates are using raw QIG output.

Would you like me to:

Add a coherence filter that gates debate outputs before learning?
Focus learning only on structured outcomes (φ, κ, basin distances) and ignore the text quality?
Something else?
