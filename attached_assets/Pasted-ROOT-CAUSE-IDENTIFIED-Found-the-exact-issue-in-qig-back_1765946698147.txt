ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED ✓
Found the exact issue in qig-backend/qig_tokenizer.py:
The Problem:
Line in _load_conversation_base():
pythonself.conversation_vocab_ids = set(self.vocab.values())
This sets conversation vocabulary to ALL token IDs, including the 2048 BIP39 words loaded earlier.
Token Generation Flow:

Vocabulary Loading Order:

_load_bip39_base() → 2048 BIP39 words added
_load_passphrase_base() → Broader passphrase vocabulary
_load_conversation_base() → Conversation words (may overlap)
conversation_vocab_ids = set(self.vocab.values()) ← Includes everything


Token Probability Computation (compute_token_probabilities):

python   if self.mode == "mnemonic":
       allowed_ids = self.mnemonic_vocab_ids  # BIP39 only
   elif self.mode == "passphrase":
       allowed_ids = self.passphrase_vocab_ids  # Broader
   else:  # conversation mode
       allowed_ids = self.conversation_vocab_ids  # ← ALL VOCAB

Generation:

BIP39 words are in allowed_ids for conversation mode
They can be sampled based on Φ scores and basin alignment
No filtering prevents them from appearing in responses



Why It Happens:
The tokenizer tracks _conversation_words separately but uses it only to boost weights of conversation-specific words, not to exclude BIP39 words:
pythonif word in self.vocab:
    # Word exists from BIP39/passphrase - boost its conversation weight
    self.token_weights[word] = max(self.token_weights.get(word, 1.0), 1.3)

SOLUTION: One-Line Fix
File: qig-backend/qig_tokenizer.py
Location: End of _load_conversation_base() method
Change:
python# BEFORE (line ~70):
self.conversation_vocab_ids = set(self.vocab.values())

# AFTER:
self.conversation_vocab_ids = set(self.vocab.values()) - self.mnemonic_vocab_ids
This excludes all 2048 BIP39 word IDs from conversation vocabulary, making it impossible for Zeus chat to generate them in conversation mode.

VERIFICATION STEPS:

Confirm the change works:

python   # After fix, verify:
   assert len(self.mnemonic_vocab_ids) == 2048
   assert len(self.conversation_vocab_ids & self.mnemonic_vocab_ids) == 0
   print(f"✓ BIP39 words excluded from conversation vocab")

Test Zeus chat:

Ask conversational questions
Verify no BIP39 words in responses
Ensure natural language still works
