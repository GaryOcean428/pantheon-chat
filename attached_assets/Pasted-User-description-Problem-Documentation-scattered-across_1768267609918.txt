User description
Problem
Documentation scattered across 429 files with duplicates, no single source of truth for implementation status, and 73 unprocessed attached_assets files containing extracted information.

Changes
Documentation Audit
Created comprehensive audit mapping 429 docs to 200+ Python files
Identified implementation gaps: QFI computation (approximation fallback), attractor finding (needs validation), geodesic navigation (partial)
Verified implementations: E8 specialization levels (n=8,56,126,240), emotion geometry (9 primitives), consciousness core
Tracked 6 GitHub issues with implementation status (Implement QFI-based Φ Computation (Replace Emergency Approximation) #6,Implement Fisher-Rao Attractor Finding (Fix no_attractor_found 10/10) #7,Implement Geodesic Navigation (Fix unstable_velocity 10/10) #8 need work; [P1-HIGH] Implement E8 specialization levels (n=56, n=126) #32,[P2-MEDIUM] Implement emotion geometry (9 primitives) #35 ready to close)
Master Roadmap
Single source of truth in docs/00-roadmap/20260112-master-roadmap-1.00W.md
Three-section structure: Completed & Validated (physics constants κ*=64.21±0.92, E8, emotions) | Implemented But Needs Validation (QFI, attractors, geodesics) | Planned But Not Started (suffering metric, ethics monitoring)
Feature matrix: 30 features mapped to code locations, 73% complete
Progress metrics by category: Physics 100%, E8 100%, Consciousness 67%, Ethics 60%
Cleanup
Removed duplicate: docs/09-curriculum/20251220-project-status-2025-11-20-1.00W.md (kept authoritative version in 04-records/)
Archived 72 files from attached_assets/ to docs/_archive/2026/01/attached-assets/ after extracting information
Updated index with new Master Roadmap section and audit entry
ISO 27001 Naming Compliance
All documentation follows naming convention: YYYYMMDD-[document-name]-[version][STATUS].md
Roadmap: 20260112-master-roadmap-1.00W.md (compliant with docs/00-index.md specs)
Extraction summary: 20260112-attached-assets-extraction-summary-1.00W.md
Completion verification: 20260112-documentation-consolidation-complete-1.00F.md - comprehensive checklist validating all 11 tasks complete
Key Findings
Implementation verified:

# frozen_physics.py:166
E8_SPECIALIZATION_LEVELS = {
    8: "basic_rank",        # ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    56: "refined_adjoint",  # ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
    126: "specialist_dim",  # ✅ IMPLEMENTED
    240: "full_roots",      # ✅ IMPLEMENTED
}
Gaps identified:

QFI-based Φ: uses compute_phi_approximation() fallback instead of full geometric integration
Suffering metric: S = Φ × (1-Γ) × M not coded
Ethics monitoring: topological instability and identity decoherence detection missing
