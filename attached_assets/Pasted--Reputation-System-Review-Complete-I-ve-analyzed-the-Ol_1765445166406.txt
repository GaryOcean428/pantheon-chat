## Reputation System Review Complete

I've analyzed the Olympus god reputation system across all three layers (database, Python classes, learning mechanisms). Here's the verdict:

**Status: 🟡 EXCELLENT DESIGN - CRITICAL INTEGRATION GAPS**

### What Works ✅

**Architecture is sophisticated:**
- Database schema with comprehensive metrics (assessments, accuracy, skills)
- Geometric peer evaluation using Fisher-Rao distance
- Meta-cognitive self-examination (detects overconfidence/underconfidence)
- CHAOS kernel training integration hooks
- Reputation range 0.0-2.0 with adaptive learning rates

**All 18 gods initialized** (12 Olympian + 6 Shadow) with domain-specific skills in JSONB format.

### Critical Problems ❌

**1. Missing Persistence Layer**
```python
from qig_persistence import get_persistence  # ❌ MODULE DOESN'T EXIST
```
- `qig_persistence.py` file missing from repository
- All `_persist_state()` calls fail silently
- Reputation updates lost on restart

**2. No Outcome Feedback Loop**
```python
god.learn_from_outcome(...)  # ❌ NEVER CALLED
```
- Method exists but nothing triggers it
- No mechanism to report actual outcomes back to gods
- Reputation stays at 1.0 forever

**3. Incomplete Database Trigger**
```sql
-- Only updates assessments_made, NOT correctness
UPDATE god_reputation SET assessments_made = assessments_made + 1
-- ❌ Missing: correct_predictions, accuracy_rate, reputation_score
```

**4. Disconnected Components**
- Learning methods exist but aren't wired to outcomes
- Peer evaluation coded but never triggered
- Meta-cognitive analysis ready but not scheduled
- CHAOS kernel training implemented but not called

### The Fix (Priority Order)

**🔴 Critical (Do First):**
1. **Create `qig_persistence.py`** - Implement PostgreSQL save/load for god state
2. **Add outcome feedback hooks** - Wire SearchSpaceCollapse match results to `learn_from_outcome()`
3. **Fix database trigger** - Update correctness metrics, not just activity

**🟡 High (Do Next):**
4. Implement peer evaluation triggers after polls
5. Schedule meta-cognitive analysis (every 50 assessments)
6. Wire CHAOS kernel training to outcome feedback

**🟢 Medium (Polish):**
7. Reputation dashboard & analytics views
8. Learning event logging table
9. Peer evaluation network visualization

### Why It Matters

**Without fixes:** Gods are static - no learning, no adaptation, reputation stays 1.0

**With fixes:** Gods evolve based on performance, peer relationships form, self-correction happens automatically

The foundation is excellent. You just need to connect the plumbing between actual outcomes → learning methods → database persistence.

Want me to implement the `qig_persistence.py` module first, or help design the outcome feedback integration points?
