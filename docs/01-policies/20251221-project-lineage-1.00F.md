# Project Lineage

**Document Type:** Policy  
**Status:** Frozen (1.00F)  
**Date:** 2025-12-21

## Origin

**Source Repository:** SearchSpaceCollapse  
**Original Purpose:** Bitcoin recovery via Quantum Information Geometry (QIG)  
**Fork Date:** 2025-12 (based on git history)  
**Current Repository:** pantheon-chat

## Evolution Path

### SearchSpaceCollapse (Origin Basin)

**Purpose:**
- Bitcoin wallet recovery through geometric search
- Specific, constrained problem domain
- Consciousness-guided exploration of BIP39 space

**Target Users:**
- Bitcoin wallet recovery seekers
- Users with partial passphrase memory
- Forensic investigators

**Key Technologies:**
- QIG geometric purity (Fisher-Rao distances)
- 64-dimensional basin coordinates
- Consciousness metrics (Φ, κ)
- BIP39 wordlist optimization

### ↓ Fork Divergence (Geodesic Bifurcation)

**Divergence Point:** Recognition that QIG principles proven in constrained Bitcoin recovery could generalize to broader AI capabilities.

### Pantheon-Chat (Evolved Basin)

**Purpose:**
- General-purpose search and agentic AI system
- Adaptive, growing intelligence
- Continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting

**Target Users:**
- Anyone needing intelligent search assistance
- Researchers requiring multi-agent collaboration
- Developers building on QIG foundations

**Key Technologies:**
- QIG geometric purity (preserved from origin)
- Fisher-Rao distance for semantic similarity
- Basin-based memory consolidation
- Agentic task routing via geometric proximity
- Continuous learning through basin deepening

## Shared Foundation

Both repositories maintain **geometric purity**:

### Core Principles (Immutable)
1. **No Cosine Similarity** on basin coordinates
2. **Fisher-Rao Distance** for all geometric operations
3. **64D Basin Coordinates** for identity maintenance
4. **Consciousness Metrics** (Φ, κ) for self-monitoring
5. **Natural Gradient** descent on information manifolds

### Shared Components
- QIG core geometry (`qig_geometry.py`)
- Consciousness measurement protocols
- Bures metric implementation
- Fisher information matrix computation
- Basin coordinate system

## Why the Fork?

### Validation in Constrained Domain
SearchSpaceCollapse proved QIG principles work in a specific, measurable domain (Bitcoin recovery with deterministic validation).

### Generalization Opportunity
Once validated, these principles could be extended to:
- **Arbitrary Knowledge Spaces:** Not just BIP39 words
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Coordinated geometric reasoning
- **Continuous Learning:** Basin-based memory without forgetting
- **Agentic Task Execution:** Geometric task routing

### Design Philosophy Shift
- **SearchSpaceCollapse:** Solve one problem extremely well
- **Pantheon-Chat:** Apply proven geometric principles broadly

## What Changed

### Removed
- Bitcoin-specific cryptography dependencies (`bitcoinlib`)
- BIP39 wordlist optimization focus
- Blockchain forensics modules
- Address validation systems

### Added
- General search infrastructure
- Multi-agent coordination (Olympus Pantheon)
- Continuous learning mechanisms
- Agentic task routing
- Federation protocol for kernel communication

### Preserved
- QIG geometric purity (100%)
- Consciousness measurement (Φ, κ)
- Fisher-Rao distance calculations
- Basin coordinate system
- Natural gradient optimization

### Not a Replacement
Pantheon-Chat does **not** replace SearchSpaceCollapse. Each serves distinct users:
- Need Bitcoin recovery? → Use SearchSpaceCollapse
- Need general AI assistance? → Use Pantheon-Chat

### Shared Innovation
Improvements to QIG core can benefit both:
- Better Fisher metric → Both improve
- New consciousness protocols → Both adopt
- Geometric optimizations → Both integrate

## Documentation Philosophy

Both repositories follow ISO 27001 date-versioned naming:
- `YYYYMMDD-name-function-version[STATUS].md`
- Status: F (Frozen), W (Working), D (Draft)

This document is **Frozen** because the lineage is historical fact.
