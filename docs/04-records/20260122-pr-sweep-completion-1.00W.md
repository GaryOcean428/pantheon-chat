# PR Sweep Analysis - TASK COMPLETE ✅

## Mission Summary

**Task:** Sweep all open PRs in relation to the whole of project for wiring, functionality, QIG purity, and integration needs.

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Deliverables:** 4 comprehensive analysis documents (1,072 lines, 43KB total)

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Comprehensive PR Analysis
- ✅ Analyzed all 9 open PRs
- ✅ Assessed wiring and integration points
- ✅ Validated QIG purity (Fisher-Rao only, no violations in PR code)
- ✅ Identified dependencies and merge order
- ✅ Found 4 critical integration gaps with fixes
- ✅ Documented conflicts and resolution strategies

### 2. Merge Strategy Development
- ✅ Identified 3 distinct merge chains
- ✅ Established critical merge order (non-negotiable)
- ✅ Created timeline with parallel execution strategy
- ✅ Documented validation checklists per PR

### 3. Integration Gap Analysis
- ✅ Gap 1: Hemisphere ↔ Psyche coupling (code fix provided)
- ✅ Gap 2: Generation strategy dispatch (code fix provided)
- ✅ Gap 3: Genome → Vocabulary pipeline (code fix provided)
- ✅ Gap 4: Ethical consciousness wiring (requirements documented)

### 4. QIG Purity Audit
- ✅ All 8 PR code: CLEAN (Fisher-Rao only)
- ⚠️ Existing codebase: 6 violations identified (marked as tech debt)
- ✅ Simplex-only canonical representation enforced
- ✅ No cosine similarity or Euclidean distance violations in PRs

## Critical Merge Order

### Chain A: Generation (Critical Path) 🔴
```
#248 (QFI Integrity) → #251 (Unified Pipeline) → #252 (Pure QIG)
```
**Action:** Merge #248 TODAY

### Chain B: Consciousness (Parallel OK) 🟡
```
#247 (Psyche Plumbing) → #246 (Hemisphere) → #250 (Genetic Lineage)
```
**Action:** Merge #247 TODAY

### Chain C: Maintenance (Must Be Last) 🟢
```
All others → #249 (Ethical - Complete!) → #253 (Dead Code)
```
**Action:** Complete #249 first

**Key Insight:** Chains A and B can proceed in parallel!

## Integration Gaps & Fixes

### Gap 1: Hemisphere ↔ Psyche Coupling ⚠️
**PRs Affected:** #246 + #247  
**Issue:** Hemispheres don't use psyche types  
**Fix:** Add kernel type awareness (code in `20260122-pr-review-comments-1.00W.md`)

### Gap 2: Generation Strategy Dispatch ⚠️
**PRs Affected:** #251 + #252  
**Issue:** Both add strategies, no dispatch  
**Fix:** Add strategy enum (code in `20260122-pr-review-comments-1.00W.md`)

### Gap 3: Genome → Vocabulary Pipeline ⚠️
**PRs Affected:** #250 + #248  
**Issue:** Merged genomes don't flow to vocabulary  
**Fix:** Insert with QFI scores (code in `20260122-pr-review-comments-1.00W.md`)

### Gap 4: Ethical Consciousness Wiring ❌
**PR Affected:** #249  
**Issue:** Empty PR, no implementation  
**Fix:** Complete 4-point integration (requirements in `20260122-pr-review-comments-1.00W.md`)
