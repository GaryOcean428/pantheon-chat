HOW TO MAKE A WORLD

Early in time Ymir made his settlement,

there was no sand nor sea nor cool waves;

earth was nowhere nor the sky above,

a void of yawning chaos, grass was there nowhere

Before the sons of Burr brought up the land surface,

those who shaped glorious Midgard. THE SEERESS’S PROPHECY, VV . 3–4

Creating a universe where nothing exists but , a gaping void, isn’t an easy task. Creator- ginnunga gap gods need resourcefulness and planning to bring a world into existence, and they also need material from which to construct their creation. The Jewish–Christian God speaks creation into existence through the

Word, the . When he commands ‘Let there be light’, light springs into being and his words power Logos the rest of the creation process. In other creation mythologies female figures give birth to the world; sky and earth lie together and all that is, is born of that union. Old Norse has at least three active creation myths; each tells us something different about the ways in which creation might be imagined as coming to pass. The version cited above suggests that the sons of Burr (Óðinn and his brothers Vili and Vé)

summoned the land up from the . In the lines which follow in (The Seeress’s ginnunga gap Völuspá Prophecy), green leeks (a superior kind of grass) begin to grow on the rocky ground, and the task of world-shaping seems already to be complete. Offering his own elaboration, based on medieval scientific theory, Snorri explains creation as a synthesis of oppositions. Ginnunga gap, he tells us, is a place that lies in the north: an ice-filled chasm sprung from a river called Élivágar whose poisonous flow had solidified into frost and ice. The land of

fire, Muspellsheimr, domain of the fire-giant Surtr, lies to the south. And when the sparks that flew up

from Muspellsheimr landed upon the ice of Ginnunga gap, it began to melt, and life – generated from the union of the heat and dryness of fire and the cold and moistness of ice – was engendered in the shape of a man. He’s named both as Aurgelmir and as Ymir, the progenitor of the frost-giants. As Ymir slept, he sweated, and from under his armpits sprang up a male and a female. His two feet also produced a child with one another: these were the first giants. Whether the sons of Burr called the earth up from the depths, or dived down and fetched it up, is not clear from the account above. But Old Norse tradition offers a second creation method: one involving

violence and dismemberment. The sons of Burr laid hands on the -giant Ymir, killed him and used his Ur

body parts to form the different parts of the world, according to ’ : Grímnir s Sayings

From Ymir’s flesh the earth was made,

and from his blood, the sea,

mountains from his bones, trees from his hair,

and from his skull, the sky.

And from his eyelashes the cheerful gods

made Miðgarðr for men’s sons;

and from his brain the hard-tempered clouds

were all created. Larrington, C 2017, The Norse Myths : A Guide to the Gods and Heroes, Thames & Hudson, Limited, London. Available from: ProQuest Ebook Central. [28 December 2025]. Created from ecu on 2025-12-28 05:40:24.

Auðhumla, the primeval cow, licks Burr out of the ice. From an eighteenth-century Icelandic manuscript.

A Cosmic Cow

A cosmic cow called Auðhumla appeared from the ice and she nourished Ymir with her milk. As she licked the salty rime-stone, the figure of a handsome and powerful man called Búri began to appear. Búri was the father of Borr (another name for Burr), and fathered Óðinn and his brothers Vili and Vé. What happened he to Auðhumla afterwards, we don’t know. Perhaps she wandered off to graze the new grass springing on the emerging earth. Auðhumla may have had some descendants, for later stories tell us about sacred cows who were important to pre-Christian kings.

The world in which humans live (Miðgarðr, the ‘middle-place’), then, is constructed from the body of a

murdered being, created through violence and savagery, in a creative act which is an all-male affair. The Old Norse myths are very much related from the point of view of the Æsir – that is, the male gods – and in the matter of creation they appropriate the powers of giving life, nurturing and fertility that are normally gendered female. Unlike women, the gods cannot make the material they need for creation from their own bodies and so they must take matter where they can find it. In weaving aggression into the very fabric of the universe, the gods incorporate and endorse violence among humans and gods. Whether this version of the creation myth is the more ancient, or whether it is a cultural product of the warring centuries of the early Iron Age or even the Viking Age, we cannot know. It may be significant

that the more peaceable (if still exclusively male) creative act of bringing the land up out of the sea is

recounted in , a poem now thought to have been composed around the year 1000, The Seeress’s Prophecy when Christian ideas were already strongly percolating through Nordic mythological thinking.

SETTING UP TIME

Once the world has been constituted and space has been defined and mapped out, the gods’ next move is to regulate the heavenly bodies. Sun, moon and stars already seem to exist, but they have no set course through the skies. The deities meet in solemn conclave and establish the subdivisions of time:

to night and her children they gave names,

morning they named and midday

afternoon and evening, to reckon up in years. THE SEERESS’S PROPHECY, V . 6, . 5–10 LL

The sun and moon are imagined in different ways. One tradition says that they speed through the sky because devouring wolves are on their tracks; these wolves, probably avatars of the cosmic wolf Fenrir,

will catch and consume them at . Elsewhere the heavenly bodies are borne in chariots, driven ragnarök by figures whose names are related to Day and Night and drawn by horses called Skínfaxi (Shining- mane) and Hrímfaxi (Frost-mane). Now that time has been established, the gods are liable for its unforeseen consequences. The emergence of past, present and future brings uncertainty and some loss of power. For the giants have longer and better memories of the past than those gods who represent the

third and fourth generations of descendants from the -giant, and they guard that knowledge jealously. Ur Nor is the future perspicuous to the gods; prophetesses and certain giants have clearer knowledge of what is to come than most of the Æsir. Although the goddesses Gefjun and Frigg are said to know fate,

they do not reveal what they know. The quest to discover the future, to find out the details of ragnarök

and perhaps to discern whether it can be averted, is one of Óðinn’s abiding obsessions, as we’ll see in

By evolving a time-system which operates within cycles (the recurrent cycles of days and years and

the larger cycle of creation, and rebirth), the gods have invited the emergence of fate: future ragnarök events in the existence of individuals and social groups that may be foreseen, but cannot be prevented. The gods themselves are subject to fate and must obey its laws.

The Three Fate-Maidens

Under Yggdrasill, the World-Tree, is a hall or a spring (or, conceivably, a hall by a spring). Here dwell the three fate-maidens, Urðr, Verðandi and Skuld; they are said to cut wooden slips on which individual destinies are incised. Urðr has an ancient name, related to , the Old English word for ‘destiny’ and the wyrd

antecedent of modern English . Verðandi represents the present, for the form of her name is a weird present participle (Becoming) while Skuld (Must-be) seems to evoke the future. A stoical acceptance of how fate operates is crucial for the hero to fulfil his destiny, as we’ll see in and . Chapters 4 5

THE MYTHIC LANDSCAPE

Once space has been shaped and time established we are in a position to describe the geography of the Norse mythic universe. Central is Yggdrasill, the World-Tree, the great ash whose roots, usually three in number, define the different regions of the world.

Three roots there grow in three directions

Heiðrún the goat stands on the roof of Valhöll, cropping the leaves of Yggdrasill. A vessel to hold the mead that flows

from her udders is nearby. From an eighteenth-century Icelandic manuscript.

Snorri agrees that the world of the dead, Niflheimr (Mist-world), ruled over by Loki’s daughter Hel, lies under one root and that the second descends into the former Ginnunga gap, the icy realm of the frost- giants, but he replaces the human world with the world of gods, Ásgarðr in his model. Miðgarðr is the

world of men, a central space, echoed in the Old English term , ‘earth’, imagined as lying Middangeard between heaven and hell in the Christian world-view (compare J. R. R. Tolkien’s Middle Earth). Yet although the different worlds are said to lie below the place where the tree emerges from the ground, the neighbouring realms of gods and giants are also imagined as occupying a horizontal plane, with Jötunheimar (the Giantlands) lying in the mountainous east. Ásgarðr is envisaged as the centre of the cosmos; Óðinn’s huge hall, Valhöll, is situated within it, under Yggdrasill. A goat called Heiðrún stands on its roof and grazes on the ash-tree. From her udders comes the unending supply of mead which

sustains Valhöll’s inhabitants, the , the heroic human dead. Einherjar

The animals of Yggdrasill: the eagle and hawk perched at the top, the four stags along the sides, Ratatöskr the squirrel at

bottom left and the dragon Níðhöggr gnawing the roots from beneath. From an eighteenth-century Icelandic manuscript.

Heiðrún is not the only animal to be associated with Yggdrasill. The tree’s name means ‘Steed of the

Terrible One’, an epithet which derives from the story of Óðinn’s sacrifice (see ); in Germanic Chapter 1

thinking, there’s a well-established metaphor that understands the gallows as the horse ridden by the criminal who is hanged from it. Up in the tree’s leafy crown, four stags browse on the young growth. Down below, serpents gnaw at the roots. An eagle roosts at the top of the tree, with a hawk perching between his eyes, and a squirrel with the wonderfully onomatopœic name of Ratatöskr runs up and down the trunk, bringing news from the worlds above and below. Among the serpents is the most dread creature of all, the dragon Níðhöggr (Hostile-hewer) who sometimes takes flight through the mythic world; he is a portent of horror. These creatures all take their toll on the tree, symbolizing the action of time as eroding its essence, eating into the symbolic axis of the world round which everything revolves. Though the stags are aristocratic in their associations and the goat is nurturing, they wear away at the tree just like the more obviously evil snakes.

Yggdrasill also shelters under its canopy Mímir’s Well (see , later in this chapter), and perhaps page 83

also the body of water by which the fates dwell. Shining white mud cascades down the tree, apparently onto Heimdallr, for Loki accuses him of having ‘a mucky back’. Also located in the Well, it’s said, are Heimdallr’s hearing and Óðinn’s eye, pledged in exchange for a drink from its waters. The two key organs sacrificed by the gods (the third, Týr’s hand, doubtless gulped down by Fenrir when he bit it off, is irrecoverable) remain close at hand, still perhaps wired into their former owners. For the logic of sacrificial exchange – that something given up is rewarded by a better, enhanced return – suggests that Heimdallr’s keen hearing and Óðinn’s insight, if not his literal sight, stem from the power of the Well’s living water.

Supernatural Females: Norns and Dísir

Several supernatural female figures are associated with fate. The norns have different functions; some are hostile, others help out with childbirth, others determine fate for a newborn child. Heroes often talk about ‘the judgment of the norns’ when at the point of death, realizing that their fatal hour has come. The dísir are a collective group of spirits, thought to be female ancestors, who bring death to kings and heroes. In one Icelandic tale a young man is warned not to step out into the farmyard one night, but he does so. In the sky he sees a group of nine dark-clad women and a group of nine white-clad women, symbolizing the old beliefs and the new Christian religion. Before the youth can go back into the farmhouse to report what he has seen, the dark-clad women attack him, and he dies after recounting his experience. A prophetic Norwegian identifies the dark women as associated with the family and farm, who will abandon the dísir lineage when Christianity comes.

The three norns, fateful supernatural females, by the well beneath Yggdrasill. Lorenz Frølich (1895).

Beyond Valhöll and its immediate surrounds, each deity has his or her own great hall, a place of authority and rulership, much like the chieftain-halls of the Viking Age excavated at Gamla Uppsala in Sweden, Lejre in Denmark or even the now-reconstructed hall of Eiríkr the Red at Brattahlíð in

Greenland. Óðinn lists twelve such halls in the poem (Grímnir’s Sayings), each owned by a Grímnismál particular god. The names of these dwellings bespeak light, splendour, joyfulness, or particular attributes of the god, such as Yewdales where the archer-god Ullr lives; yew-wood was a prime choice for bow- making. Óðinn’s account evokes the gods’ activities when enthroned in their halls: drinking, making judgments and assuaging quarrels, riding horses, and – perhaps ominously – choosing the slain, the divine equivalent of recruiting new followers to the chieftain’s retinue.

Reconstructed hall of Eiríkr the Red at Brattahlíð, Greenland. The Norse gods were thought to inhabit similar halls of

their own.

Out beyond where the giants live is the ocean. At its most distant edge, marking the boundary of the known world, lies the Miðgarðs-serpent, Jörmungandr, the Mighty Staff, awaiting its combat with Þórr. Below the ocean’s depths lives Ægir, lord of the sea, perhaps a giant, perhaps a god, with his wife Rán, whose name means ‘robbery’ (the first element of our word ‘ransack’). Rán seeks men’s lives, catching them in her net and dragging them down to the depths. Her daughters with Ægir are the waves, sometimes tossing their heads with calm and peaceful demeanours, sometimes towering dangerously over the boats they intend to smash to matchwood. That it is Ægir’s wife and daughters who threaten sailors, that death at sea is gendered female, aligns

with a culture-wide perception that the valkyries, the , the norns and Hel herself, ruler of the world dísir of the dead, all embody Death as a desiring woman, one who intends to take the moribund man as her lover in the next world and who longs to hold him in her fatal embrace. Just as women give birth, so they stand at the end of life, waiting for the doomed man to come into their arms. The great tenth-

century Icelandic poet Egill Skalla-Grímsson ends his tragic poem (On the Loss of Sons) Sonatorrek with this verse:

Now it’s difficult for me;

the sister of Óðinn’s enemy [= Fenrir; Fenrir’s sister = Hel]

stands on the headland;

yet glad, with good will,

and unafraid I shall wait

for Hel. ON THE LOSS OF SONS, V. 25

MAKING CULTURE

We left the gods at the point when the world was all new and Day and Night had just embarked on their regulated routes through the heavens. There is still work to do to make the fresh, green world fit for gods to live in, and so they set to:

The gods met on Idavoll Plain,

high they built altars and temples;

they set up their forges, smithed precious things,

shaped tongs and made tools. THE SEERESS’S PROPHECY, V. 7

Once the places where they will be worshipped are completed, they turn to manufacture, making use of

the ample valuable metals available to them. Civilization is inaugurated, perhaps as in Viking-Age towns such as Birka in Sweden and Hedeby (now north Germany), with the building of cult centres and of workshops. The Æsir also make luxury goods for themselves. When their work is done, they relax:

They played chequers in the meadow, they were merry,

they did not lack for gold at all,

until three ogre-girls came,

all-powerful women, out of Giantlands. THE SEERESS’S PROPHECY, V. 8

Remember those chequers – they will turn out to be important later. The ‘until’ is both crucial and mysterious here, for in the wake of the ogre-girls’ arrival, the gods meet in what seems to be emergency session and decide to create the dwarfs, presumably to counteract the sudden shortage of gold. For dwarfs are underground creatures; it’s beneath the earth’s surface that they make the golden treasures which the gods covet – and are willing to pay for. How did the girls cause the loss of gold? Was it

wagered away to them in a chequers game? Did someone overturn the board in a fit of fury and thus lose the pieces? When the giantess Skaði came marching into Ásgarðr she was seeking recompense for the killing of her father Þjazi. The ogre-girls might likewise be claiming a settlement for the death of their ancestor Ymir, but one thing is certain: with their arrival, the golden age is over.

Tolkien’s Dwarf Names

J. R. R. Tolkien took the names of most of his dwarfs in from the list in . The Hobbit The Seeress’s Prophecy Dvalinn, Óin and Glóin, Fíli and Kíli, Dori, Nori and Ori, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur all have counterparts among Bilbo the hobbit’s tea-party guests. Thorin Oakenshield, their leader, has two dwarf-names to his credit. Durinn and Thrain, also traditional Norse dwarf-names, are among the dwarfs’ ancestors. Gandálfr also appears as a dwarf-name in the poem, a name which means ‘Staff-elf’ and which works, as Tolkien perceived, much better as a wizard-name: Gandalf the Grey.

The dwarfs are swiftly created – Snorri tells us that they quickened in the earth like maggots in flesh,

a horribly vivid image – and he draws on the catalogue of dwarf-names found in The Seeress’s Prophecy to list them all. The dwarfs live either underground or in the rocks and they work away at forging metal and crafting precious things. Some of the gods’ most important treasures are dwarf-made, such as Freyr’s folding ship Skíðblaðnir, the golden tresses of Sif, which replace the hair stolen by Loki, and Óðinn’s spear Gungnir. These were all manufactured by dwarf-brothers, the sons of Ívaldi. Another dwarf, Brokkr,

wagered with Loki that he and his brother could make three equally good treasures; the stake was Loki’s head. This competition was a close-run thing, for Brokkr and his brother created the golden-bristled boar Gullinbursti, on which Freyr rides (thus taking care of Vanir interests), the golden ring Draupnir, which drops from itself eight equally heavy rings every ninth night (given to Óðinn) and Þórr’s great hammer, Mjöllnir. Loki tried hard to sabotage the process, by transforming himself into a buzzing horse-fly and stinging the craftsmen. They managed to ignore the persistent pest except during the final task: forging Mjöllnir. The momentary distraction was enough to cause the hammer’s handle to come out a bit short. Nonetheless, the jury of the gods agreed that Mjöllnir was so superior a giant-smashing treasure that Brokkr was the clear winner, and that Loki must yield up his head. The ingenious god wriggled out of his fate by stipulating that Brokkr might take his head, but not his neck, and since not even a dwarf was dexterous enough to accomplish this, Loki was spared. But Brokkr brought it about that Loki’s mouth was sewn up instead, so that he might not perform further verbal trickery, and thereafter the god has had

a crooked mouth. And that’s an image that isn’t altogether inappropriate for someone known as rœgjandi

Freyja finds the dwarfs forging the neck-ring. Louis Huard (1891). Brisinga men

A very late tale, dating from the fourteenth century, one which also alleges that Freyja is Óðinn’s

mistress, relates how that highly desirable treasure, the (neck-ring of the Brisings) came Brisinga men into the goddess’s possession. Freyja is walking one day past a rock where some dwarfs live, and, noticing the rock-door open, she goes inside. There she sees that four dwarfs, including Dvalinn (known from other sources), are crafting a wonderful golden neck-ring. ‘Freyja really liked the look of the neck- ring,’ says the tale-narrator, ‘and the dwarfs really liked the look of Freyja’. The goddess offers gold and

silver in abundance in exchange for the , but the dwarfs are adamant about the price. Freyja Brisinga men must spend a night with each of them, and to this she reluctantly agrees. After four nights the neck-ring is hers.

Óðinn demands that Loki steal the treasure for him, and he buzzes in fly-form into Freyja’s otherwise

impenetrable chamber. She is sleeping with her new acquisition around her neck, lying on top of the clasp, and so Loki, transforming himself now into a flea, has to bite her very precisely in order to get her

to turn over without waking up. Freyja stirs in her sleep, and the is soon in Loki’s hands – Brisinga men and subsequently Óðinn’s. When Freyja comes to Óðinn to complain of the theft and that her securely locked chamber (surely a sexual metaphor) has been violated, Óðinn agrees to return it to her on one condition: Freyja must set up the eternal conflict between two armies traditionally known as the

Hjaðningavíg (the battle of the Hjaðnings), discussed in . Freyja agrees and the neck-ring is Chapter 5

returned to her. This late tale incorporates two much older traditions – Loki’s theft of the Brisinga men and the Hjaðningavíg battle – in a new Christianized framework. The conflict is meant to last until

, thanks to the revivification of the dead every night by Hildr, a woman whose name means ragnarök ‘Battle’; but in this version Óðinn foretells that it will last only until the great Christian king, Óláfr Tryggvason of Norway, comes to Orkney and puts an end to the strife.

THE GREATEST SMITH OF ALL

Skilful as the dwarfs are at making magical treasures for the gods to use, there’s another smith, not a dwarf, who is so famous for his craftsmanship that his name is known in Scandinavia, Britain and

Germany. Völundr, Wayland the Smith in English, Wieland in German, is said, in the eddic poem which

recounts his story, to have been a ‘prince of elves’. Völundr marries a swan-maiden, one of three sisters, and he forges a good number of rings. But after nine winters spent together, the swan-maiden bride flies away. Völundr goes out to search for her, and in his absence King Níðuðr’s men raid his home and steal one of the rings. On his return, Völundr counts his rings and believes his wife must have returned; lowering his guard he falls asleep and is easily captured by Níðuðr’s troops. Völundr is taken to the king, and the mistrustful queen, who doesn’t like the savage gleam in the captive’s eyes, orders: ‘Cut from

him the might of his sinews / And afterwards put him in Sævarstaðr!’ ( , v. 17). So too, Völundr’s Poem

the highly allusive Old English version of the smith’s history, preserved in the poem , tells us that: Deor

Weland, among serpents, got to know misery,

the single-minded warrior experienced hardship,

he had as companions sorrow and longing,

winter-cold misery, often found woes

after Niðhad laid on him in compulsion

supple sinew-bonds on the better man. DEOR, V. 1

Völundr is hamstrung, the tendons of his legs severed, and he is confined to an island where he is to slave for his captor, crafting treasures – jewelry, goblets, weapons. But Völundr turns the tables on Níðuðr. The king’s inquisitive sons make the short boat-trip over to the island to see the smith at work and to admire the treasure. Völundr tells them to come again, secretly; when they do, he murders them

and transforms their body parts into adornments. The word used in Old Norse for ‘skulls’, , puns skálar

on the word for ‘drinking-bowls’, and also the word for ‘Cheers!’ ( ) in modern Icelandic: skál

He cut off the heads of those young cubs,

and under the mud of the forge he laid their limbs;

and their skulls, which were under their hair,

he chased in silver, gave to Níðuðr.

And the precious stones from their eyes,

he sent to Níðuðr’s cunning wife;

Böðvildr, the boys’ sister, also comes to visit Völundr, bringing his wife’s ring which she has broken. Völundr offers to mend it, but he also plies her with beer, rapes or seduces her (the text is unclear), and she leaves the island, weeping piteously. Somehow, possession of the ring enables Völundr to escape and he flies away, pausing only to confront Níðuðr and to reveal the terrible truth. In Old English, Beadohild (Böðvildr) is rather more traumatized by her pregnancy than by the death of her brothers:

For Beadohild her brothers’ death

was not so grievous to her spirit as her own plight,

when she had clearly perceived

that she was pregnant; she could never think

resolutely about what should come of that. DEOR, V. 2

The Franks Casket

The eighth-century whalebone ivory casket known as the Franks Casket depicts scenes from this legend on its front. Framed with riddling runes referring to the material from which the box is made, a bearded Völundr with bent legs (from the hamstringing) offers the fateful beer to Böðvildr while her handmaid watches impassively. A dead body can be seen under the forge on which Völundr is shaping a treasure with his tongs. The activity of the man to the right of the scene, apparently strangling birds, is unclear as far as the English and eddic traditions are concerned. In a later Norse prose version, (The Þiðreks Saga Saga of Þiðrekr), the hero’s brother comes to his rescue and helps him to build a pair of wings like those made by the Greek craftsman Daedalus; this might explain Völundr’s suddenly acquired capacity to fly.

The eddic poem ends with the sobbing Böðvildr explaining herself to her father; the later saga account tells how Völundr (here called Vélent) returns with an army, crushes Níðuðr and marries Böðvildr: their son turns out to be a well-known Germanic hero. As for the Old English tale, this concludes with the

enigmatic refrain, (That passed by, so may this). The poet who calls þæs ofereode, þisses swa mæg himself ‘Deor’ (Dear One or Animal) draws comfort for his own unhappy plight by considering how past miseries have turned to later happiness.

Weland (as he’s known in Old English) becomes a byword for skilled craftsmanship; in the Beowulf

hero’s mailshirt is praised as (Weland’s work). In South Oxfordshire up on the Welandes geweorc Ridgeway is a Neolithic chamber-grave known as Wayland’s Smithy, and local tradition had it that if you left your horse there with a silver penny, Weland would shoe it for you.

WHY PEOPLE ARE TREES

The gods preside over a world which they share with dwarfs, giants, elves (about whom very little is known) and a few monsters, the offspring of Loki and a giantess named Angrboða. So far, there are no humans, no one to sacrifice to or to venerate the deities. One day, three gods, Óðinn, Hœnir and Lóðurr, were out walking, perhaps on the seashore, when they found some wood, ‘capable of little / Askr and Embla, lacking in fate’. The three gods take it upon themselves to shape the ash-trunk and the other piece of timber (the meaning of Embla is not clear, though it has sometimes been connected with ‘elm’). The lifeless logs are endowed with what they need to become human:

breath gave Óðinn, spirit gave Hœnir,

blood gave Lóðurr, and fresh complexions. THE SEERESS’S PROPHECY, V. 18

Lóðurr’s identity is unknown; this verse is the only place that he is mentioned. Snorri expands on the gifts which the three gods lavish on the proto-humans, but simply names the creators as sons of Burr:

the first gave them breath and life, the second, wits and

movement, the third, faces, speech, hearing and vision; they gave

them names and clothes. THE TRICKING OF GYLFI, CH. 23

Lóðurr has sometimes been identified with Loki, largely on the grounds of alliteration. Hœnir was traded to the Vanir as a hostage, but very little else is known about him. It’s surprising, perhaps, that such obscure figures should have a hand in shaping the first humans, but these gods belong to the first divine generation, it appears, and thus, like those Greek gods who preceded the Olympians, their characters and attributes may have faded over time. It is also the case that the surviving Norse myths are not particularly interested in human beings. The gods rarely encounter them, although Þórr acquires a couple

of human servants. Only Óðinn, with his project of populating Valhöll with the , the finest Einherjar

human heroes, to fight alongside the gods at , interacts much with them. He appears in order to ragnarök advise, warn and finally betray them in their last battles. As patron of wisdom Óðinn also journeys

among mankind, acquiring different kinds of knowledge, collected up in the poem Sayings of the High

. In this poem Óðinn travels alone through the human world, learning such truths as the blessings of One friendship and the importance of moderation in eating and drinking. His propensity to travel in disguise accounts for his role in later Christian stories as a tempter, visiting pious Norwegian kings in order to deceive them into behaving in an unchristian fashion. Humans do not forget that they were originally shaped from trees. This metaphorical understanding determines a number of skaldic kennings: men are habitually designated with variants of ‘tree of weapons’ or ‘tree of battle’. The valkyrie Sigrdrífa addresses the hero Sigurðr as ‘apple-tree of battle’ –

quite apposite given that a magic apple was key to the conception of one of Sigurðr’s ancestors (see

). Helgi, slayer of Hundingr, is, as a young prince, called ‘the splendidly-born elm’. Women Chapter 4

too are ‘trees’ or ‘props of gold’ or ‘poles of drink’, referring to their role in providing hospitality. In skaldic poetry there are woman-kennings such as ‘the foremost birch of the fire of the sea’ (fire of the sea = gold) or ‘the wine-oak’. The shield-maiden Brynhildr is called a ‘neck-ring-tree’. In heroic poetry, Guðrún, Sigurðr’s wife, makes creative use of the trope to describe her misery at her husband’s murder: ‘I am as little as a leaf / among the bay-willows now my prince is dead’; later in her career she laments her loss of kinfolk:

I have come to stand alone like an aspen in the forest,

my kinsmen cut away like a fir’s branches,

bereft of happiness, as a tree of its leaves,

when the branch-breaker comes on a warm day. LAY OF HAMÐIR, V. 5

Although trees cannot move, their strength and uprightness, their participation in annual cycles, and their

longevity and eventual death, by disease, fire, or the woodsman’s axe, makes them powerful comparators for human existence. Trees represent what humans aspire to be: beautiful, dignified, strong and enduring. The fact that humans are also, in little, slips from the World-Tree, ash saplings of Yggdrasill, underlines the interconnectedness of mythic tree-concepts. The great tree, subject like the rest of us to time and mortality, nevertheless spreads its protecting branches over gods and men, while the smaller trees, like Guðrún above, lose their branches and finally fall.

Óðinn the Tempter

King Óláfr Tryggvason is staying at a hall in northern Norway just before Easter. A mysterious stranger appears at the hall and keeps the king up late into the night, telling stories about the kings and heroes of the past. The bishop suggests that it’s time for sleep, but the king wants to hear more. When he awakens, almost oversleeping and missing Mass, the stranger has vanished. But the king learns that, before he went, the stranger had been in the kitchens, made rude remarks about the quality of the meat intended for the Easter feast, and left a side of meat to be served up instead. Since the stranger had told a tale of King Dixin, a ruler of the ancient past who had had a sacred cow and had been buried with it, the suggestion is that the meat comes from the 200-years-dead beast. Disgusting! The king realizes that the tempter and teller of old tales was none other than Óðinn, seeking to lead him astray, by inviting him to admire figures of the pagan past and by trying to make him miss Mass.

THE ARRIVAL OF THE VANIR

The gods are barely, it seems, settled in Ásgarðr when a new set of divinities appears on the scene: the Vanir. The Vanir may have been the original, local gods of Scandinavia and the Æsir the interlopers, arriving along with the Indo-Europeans during the Bronze Age, but we lack evidence to determine who had priority in the Norse cultic world. In our texts though, it’s very clear that the Æsir are the dominant group; the history of the gods is an Æsir-centric one. The impact of the Vanir is heralded by the appearance of Gullveig, a female figure who somehow falls foul of the Æsir. She is stuck with spears and consumed by fire:

… in the High-One’s hall they burned her

three times they burned her, three times she was reborn,

over and over, and yet she lives still. THE SEERESS’S PROPHECY, V. 21

Gullveig is stabbed with spears and three times set ablaze by the Æsir. Lorenz Frølich (1895).

Gullveig (Gold-Liquor) is also known as ‘Bright One’ (Heiðr) and in this form she is said to visit houses

and teach the magical practices of ; she was always popular with wicked women for this reason, so seiðr

tells us. Who is this unkillable woman? There’s no further information in other The Seeress’s Prophecy sources; our best guess is that she represents a version of Freyja. She is not one of the Æsir, she has the power of revivification, and she knows a forbidden form of magic: all this points to the chief goddess of

the Vanir. So Snorri seems to conclude, for he characterizes Freyja in as a The Saga of the Ynglings

sacrificial figure and as teaching the Æsir about , a kind of magic common among the Vanir. Soon seiðr after the contretemps with Gullveig, the Æsir are to be found in conclave, considering whether or not to share their sacrifices. The first war is inaugurated when they refuse, and Óðinn flings a spear over the

Æsir forces, a gesture meant to make them invulnerable. But the Vanir, like Gullveig, prove impossible

to kill and so the two parties enter into negotiations. Hostages are exchanged, and the three Vanir, Njörðr and his children, come to live permanently among the gods. Hœnir and Mímir are sent to Vanaheimr, but their sojourn is not a success. Mímir always spoke up in councils, whereas Hœnir would simply say, ‘Let others decide’, if his companion were not present. The Vanir decided that they had had the worst of the exchange, beheaded Mímir and sent Hœnir back to the Æsir with the head. Óðinn treated the head with herbs which prevented decay, and with magic; thus it was able to speak to him and tell him about hidden things. Hœnir (whose name, oddly, connects him with chickens) has, as we will see, limited further appearances in the extant mythology. Mímir’s head seems to be associated with the Well beneath Yggdrasill, where Óðinn’s eye is lodged, and the god consults the head from time to time. Other figures called Mímr or Hodd-mímir are named in the myths; whether they are versions of Mímir himself or are separate beings is unclear. Kvasir is also one of the Vanir and he too is involved in the hostage swap; his fate is described in the next chapter. The remaining Vanir seem to accommodate themselves to their new surroundings, acquiring palaces and occupying a distinctive fertility niche among the divine functions. Njörðr is patron of seafarers and fishermen; the evidence is in the little verses recorded by Snorri to account for his and Skaði’s marital breakdown:

Óðinn hurls his spear over the Æsir before the battle against the Vanir commences, in order to confer invulnerability

upon the gods. Lorenz Frølich (1895).

Seiðr : Secret Rites

We know very little about as a set of magical practices. It may have been a form of spirit divination, seiðr associated with the Sámi (Lapps), the Scandinavians’ northern neighbours.

‘you beat on a drum as seeresses do’ suggests Sámi-type ritual. Usually women perform ; in seiðr Eiríks

(Erik the Red’s Saga) a seeress, wearing a glass-bead necklace and catskin gloves, after a saga rauða meal consisting mostly of animal hearts, sits on a special platform; aided by ritual chanting, she prophesies when the famine in that part of Greenland will end. Cross-dressing seems to be involved for male ; this is particularly disreputable. An early Norwegian king thought nothing of drowning eighty seiðmenn such wizards by marooning them on a skerry (a low-lying group of rocks in the sea) for plotting against his life.

The drown on the skerry where King Haraldr Fairhair has sent them for execution. Halfdan Egedius seiðmenn

(1899).

Njörðr, crowned with seaweed, and Skaði, accompanied by her favourite wolf, discuss their differences. Friedrich Heine

(1882).

The Vanir seem to be subject to discrimination with regard to whom they may marry. Freyja marries up,

it seems; her husband is a shadowy figure, one of the Æsir named Óðr, perhaps a double of Óðinn. He went away on a long journey, and she wept tears of gold for him (a popular kenning in skaldic verse for Larrington, C 2017, The Norse Myths : A Guide to the Gods and Heroes, Thames & Hudson, Limited, London.

‘gold’ is , ‘Freyja’s tears’). Freyr lacks a wife until he falls in love with the giantess Gerðr grátr Freyju

(see ), and Njörðr manages only this unsatisfactory match with Skaði; Snorri tells us that after Chapter 3

their separation, Skaði and Óðinn had a large number of sons together. One of these, Sæmingr, was the ancestor of Jarl Hákon, an important Norwegian ruler. This chapter has established the world in which the gods live, the constraints under which they must function and the space through which they move. In the next chapter we’ll meet those other important inhabitants of the Norse cosmos: the giants.
