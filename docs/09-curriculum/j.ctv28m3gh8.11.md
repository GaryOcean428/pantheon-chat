‘Fine work as always, well done’. These words of praise are given by the matron supervising a group of girls working on their needlework in the women’s bower, introducing us to two of the main characters in the epic medieval fantasy television show Game of Thrones . This scene is brimming with sibling rivalry; the eager elder sister is praised for her skill in needlework and the younger sister, who is averse to being there, glowers at her older sister while making a mess of her own work. This popular television show presents Sansa Stark as a model young woman being trained in the feminine arts, an anticipated character in a series portraying a medieval-based fantasy world: the maidenly female who excels in skills of womanly virtue. In contrast, the younger sister, Arya Stark, is presented as the opposite of this ideal, as she does not feel as if she belongs in this feminine world and instead longs to participate in masculine activities such as archery and swordplay. 1

This is a common theme in modern fantasy works based upon medieval culture: a young girl rebelling against expectations of how a young woman should act. There is a clear expectation that Sansa is the model young woman in her proper place and, through her work in improving her needlework, she is training to run her own household and make her own beautiful clothing, while Arya is rebelling against this mould and longs to be one of the boys training outside and does not feel compelled to remain inside in her proper place. This trope reflects a familiar theme found in much scholarship on medieval women,

of women kept in towers and hidden within the household while the man was active in the public sphere of work, politics, and entertainment. This idea has been drawn from a continued common image of women in Old Norse scholar - ship which focuses on a sharp division between women and men’s lives in the Icelandic Family Sagas, the Íslendingasögur . Limited source material and information about the lives of medieval women have led scholars to write histories that have often confined women to a restric - tive private sphere, failing to include them as main actors or keeping them on the peripheries of history. Medieval women, in fact, could hold numerous roles and there is not a one-size fits all model, just as is true for modern women today, and we should be cautious of essentializing their experiences. A variety of female images and experiences can be found in medieval historical sources, some examples include strong-willed wives, docile daughters, pious nuns, devoted pilgrims, and the much less reported instances of working women, servants, and slaves in everyday life. 2

The field of women’s history, especially of medieval women, has long been dealing with issues of male bias in source material and in scholars’ interpretation with their efforts to reveal women’s voices in the past. Much of what we know about medieval women has been passed down via male authors and scribes who had their own opinions and cultural conceptions of what qualities and characteristics defined good or bad women. Over the past century there has been much progress regarding the push to include women’s voices in historical study and moving beyond a male-centric historical representation. There remain, however, problems with the current treatment of gender in historical study. The contemporary issues of second and third wave feminism had greatly influenced the image of medieval women presented by modern scholars, projecting their own struggles of searching for equality and oppression into their own studies of women in the past. This is especially true in the early years of women’s history when scholars sought to find a golden age of power and equality for women in the medieval past. Regardless, growth in the field of gender history has been influential in compelling historians to look at the past with new perspectives and to broaden their subject matter to include previously neglected subject areas and to use new kinds of evidence, increasing the visibility of past women. Since Judith Brown raised the concept of a universal division of labour by sex, historians have applied a gendered division of labour to innumerable historical contexts, forming a universal labour history with men working in the public sphere and women in the private domestic sphere, this division being

determined by women’s reproductive responsibilities. 3 One cannot assume, however, that a division of labour based on sex and due to childcare responsibil - ities was universal to all historical cultures, but rather should allow for variation according to historical context. There is value in studying medieval women for their own sake, in their own historical context, and there needs to be some allowance for historical difference instead of a universalizing of experience. A new re-examination of the history of medieval women questions the reductive dichotomy of the male public sphere and female domestic sphere and considers other factors that influenced a division of labour in the medieval household. This chapter discusses gendered labour relations in medieval Iceland in a wider Western European context, drawing on the Icelandic Family Sagas and using the example of the medieval Icelandic household and in particular the production of the important woollen homespun cloth vaðmál , to demonstrate how family and social status played equally important roles in determining the division of labour. It considers how medieval women have been treated in both source materials and recent scholarship, and how textile sources can be used as alternative evidence to move past the limitations of previous accounts. Indeed, understanding vaðmál and the labour relations of cloth production can much reveal about the lives and labour of medieval Icelanders.

Medieval Women: Preserved, Appropriated, and Reconstructed

In the Icelandic family saga literature, women are notoriously absent or have been relegated to the side-lines of the narrative, with a few more extensive examples of unusually powerful, but mainly higher status, women who are generally described in terms of their physical beauty and their skills in womanly arts. 4 Such examples include Þórdís Skeggjadóttir in Bárðar saga Snæfellsáss , ‘a most beautiful and skilled woman’, Helga Arnardóttir in Flóamanna saga described as ‘the fairest and most courteous of all women’ when serving ale, and Droplaug Þorgrímsdóttir in Droplaugarsona saga , a ‘good-looking woman, possessed all kinds of skills’ and ‘superior to most women’, to name a few examples. 5 Such descriptions concern physical characteristics or how women

act in relation to men, and compare them to the position of other women, rarely referring to these women’s own accomplishments or actions within the story. This has much to do with these women being the products of saga writers who were removed from these women’s experiences both temporally and by nature of their gender; these stories were written several centuries later, through an androcentric filter, and often with a didactic intention for the stories’ audienc - es. 6 These writers are largely thought to be male clerics who promoted Christian principles and cast a social commentary on their imaginative history of a near pagan past. 7 Medieval women are seen as having specific prescribed roles and were limited to the domestic sphere for their work and daily activities. A clear influence of Christian ideal on the characterization of women in medieval narrative sources is seen in the two main images of women that often appear for female characters: the positive passive woman in the domes - tic sphere and the negative image of the woman active in the public sphere. 8

This is an interesting comparison to contemporary pop culture and literature, such as Game of Thrones , that extols female characters who break traditional gender norms. 9 The influence of this Christian ideology can be seen in the Icelandic Family Sagas as well. They generally do not hold a positive characterization of females who are active in the male domain and rarely mention women wielding weapons, and women who act out of gender norms are punished for it or return to their proper space by the end of the story. 10

Female characters such as Sansa, who are shown to be embroidering or other traditional female activities, are seen as boring and given negative connotations of oppression. 10 For a discussion on women and weapons in the Íslendingasögur and wider Old Norse corpus, see Jóhanna Katrín Friðriksdóttir, Valkyrie: The Women of the Viking World (London, 2020), pp. 56 ff.

Gísla saga Súrssonar offers an example of this comparison of positive and negative characterization of women. Gísli Súrsson has foreboding dreams which include two contrasting women, which reflect our ideas concerning proper roles for medieval women. He calls one the good-dream woman and the other the bad-dream woman. The good-dream woman is described using kennings related to roles expected of Old Norse women, including ‘thread-goddess’ and ‘bearer of the ale-horn’ and she invites him into her great hall that is described as beautifully decorated with cushions on the raised benches. The bad-dream woman is described using violent and gory kennings that relate to valkyries on a battlefield:

the valkyrie’s hands, dripping with sword rain, placed a bloody cap upon my thickly grown, straight-cut locks of hair. 11

The two women are posited against each other, with good being associated with a woman in the home, preoccupied with womanly tasks of cloth work and with serving food and drink, and the bad being associated with the tradi - tional male sphere of the battlefield and violence. On the other hand, however, there are instances of women being described acting in traditionally male areas and activities, but are not vilified, gen - erally because they are acting to protect their family and household. One such example is in Laxdæla saga when Helgi Harðbeinsson has the women working at the shieling dress in men’s clothing and ride horses to the main house, pretending to a group of attacking men that there are men present and giving the household time to gather men to protect them from the attackers. 12

In general, the family sagas present the image of women in prescribed roles and limited to the domestic sphere in their daily activities, but the instances that break from this norm presents trouble for the historian trying to general - ize the experience of medieval Icelandic women. These few, uncommon examples of strong female characters found in the Icelandic sagas have been adopted as evidence of an era of equality, status, and opportunity for medieval women. Conversely, they have also been used as

proof of historical patriarchal subjugation. 13 A common example of a strong female character is the female inciting her male relatives into an action of revenge, such in Laxdæla saga when Þorgerðr insists on accompanying her sons to a violent confrontation because she knows that her sons ‘will likely require some urging yet’ and also when Guðrún spread out bloodstained clothes to call her sons to avenge their father’s death. 14 However, as exciting as these few examples may be, in reality, such examples are sparse and should be used with caution. Many of the few female characters are actually ordinary women carrying out their daily household tasks. It is important to look at these normative and ordinary women in the family sagas as worthy subjects of study in their own right. This allows a more inclusive and representative account of women’s history, as this would likely reflect the experience of the majority and not the few strong, exceptional women who have been empha - sized in past scholarship. We can give historical women agency by seeking out their own voices, without reducing them to political tools or as material for modern fantasies. The images of women presented in the Icelandic Family Sagas and propa - gated in modern scholarship offer clearly prescribed roles and limited spaces for medieval women, largely limiting their participation in the past as limited to the private, domestic space of the household. However, the idea of a universal division of labour by sex, which has been translated into the idea of separate domestic and public spheres of activities, needs to be used with caution and its appropriateness to medieval history must be considered as female domestic space is not the same for all cultures and periods of history, but is always socially constructed and reflects particular historical contexts. 15 Today, women are not tied to the private sphere of the home and work is considered the opposite of leisure and generally involves wages or monetary compensation. This was not the case in the medieval period, especially for women, and particularly since working and living space were often the same and used simultaneously. The separation of household labour, especially women’s work, from the economy in historical study has its roots in the rise of a rigid sexual division of labour that accompanied changing gender ideology that was associated with the rise of commerce and urbanism in European cities from the fourteenth century. I will briefly address this perspective, which has had a significant influence on how modern scholars have considered the role of women in the medieval period.

Work has not been historically restricted to the public sphere but took place both within and outside the household. 16 Often there was much overlap and fluidity of gender labour roles as the family worked together as a whole for its own welfare, rather than mainly for wages and income. 17 There was little segregation of space, as for most people and households there was an overall lack of privacy in houses with only one, or few, multipurpose rooms. This changed as the growth of commercial activity and urbanism in Europe from the late medieval period led to an increase in social stratification with the rise of the bourgeois class, who built multi-roomed houses that had separate, spe - cific functioning rooms. 18 Houses became larger and there was an increase in physical privacy and the separation of people from different social classes. 19

The rise of waged labour also led to the physical separation of work and home and of men’s and women’s workspace, as there was a change in the nature of and place for work in the home. Men’s work took place in work - shops or dedicated spaces outside of the home, while women’s work largely remained in the home. This led to the separation of space, such as separate kitchens and dining spaces and different rooms for eating, sleeping, leisure, and different types of work being appropriate for different social classes and genders. A distinct ideological separation between productive waged work and reproductive labour developed, aligning with a gendered separation of types of work, with women’s largely reproductive labour (such as food pro - duction, childcare, housework) becoming less visible, although both men and women’s labour were essential to and together formed the economy. 20

This cultural construct of separate spheres of influence for men and women continued into later centuries and was especially expanded in the nineteenth century with the growth of the cult of domesticity, Victorian ideas of ideal motherhood and the domestic associated with feminine virtue. There were ideological ties of morality and altruism to the private sphere of women and it

16 Albeit historically women’s labour has often not been considered work, but rather duty and obligation, or was not discussed at all. This has largely been dependent on interpretation of what work is and whether women’s labour is included in the concept of work, as this interpretation is different depending on historical context. 17 Anne Stalsberg, ‘Women as Actors in North European Viking Age Trade’, in Ross Samson (ed.), Social Approaches to Viking Studies (Glasgow, 1991), pp. 75–83, at p. 81. 18 Martha Howell, ‘The Gender of Europe’s Commercial Economy, 1200–1700’, Gender & History , 20:3 (2008), 519–38, at pp. 520–1. 19 Sarah Rees Jones and Felicity Riddy, ‘The Botton Hours of York: Female Domestic Piety and the Public Space’, in Anneke B.

would be considered neglectful to their family and duty if women entered the public male sphere of work. 21 Women’s labour within the house was also not considered work, but rather the duty and obligation of the housewife, as only labour in exchange for wages was considered work, which became a way of distinguishing the middle class from the working classes. 22 The home was women’s space and a safe haven for the family, the home was separated from the workplace, and women were dependent on the income of men. 23

These developments had great influence on what was considered appropri - ate subject matter in economic history, which largely excluded non-monetary work, such as women’s labour and other activities in the household. These later ideas of appropriate gender roles and spaces have influenced modern scholarship, and we need to be careful to clarify the historical context of such ideas when discussing the medieval past. In all likelihood, the medieval household actually acted as a complementary unit, a place where many com - munal activities and functions took place at the same time, in coordination with each other and spread across and connected between private and public spaces. 24 The household was the central social space in a medieval person’s life, the place of reproduction, production, and consumption, and all these activities could take place in the same area. 25

It is important, in this case, to recognize that the work of men and women was not waged nor distinctly segregated in medieval Iceland, with the small, one-roomed houses that were more common to the general populace of medieval Iceland. The only real privacy, in the more modern sense, was that of the husband and wife in their bed closet, an architectural feature that is mentioned in several sagas, such as Helgi who ‘usually sleeps in a sturdily built bed closet’ in Laxdæla saga , Þórðr and Oddný and their serving woman who slept in a separate room

in Bjarnar saga Hítdælakappa , Þorgrímr and Þórdís who slept in a bed closet in Gísla saga Súrssonar , and Helgi who had a locked bed closet in Droplaugarsona saga . 26 Space use was usually determined by social stratification and the wealth of a household, which was reflected in architecture in terms of size and use. The whole household participated in work in some way and often in the same space, working in domestic areas of activity that can be better described as overlapping rather than segregated or separate spaces. There could be ded - icated areas in households for prolonged and specialized tasks, such as textile or metal craft production, but many of these spaces were multi-use areas intended for the productive activities of both men and women. Hallfreðar saga Vandræðaskálds tells of shepherds and women both working at the shiel - ings in Laxárdal. 27 Eyrbyggja saga gives an account of Katla, the mistress of the household, sitting on the crossbench in the main room of the hall working at spinning from her distaff, a place that is shared by men and women and open to guests. 28 These private and public spheres of home and work life influenced each other and were not so easily distinguishable from each other. The problems that come from a preserved bias, appropriation of the past, and misapplication of later gender ideologies on the study of earlier periods can be combated by using traditional texts in combination with alternate source material. Cloth is a great tool to help us reconstruct ideas of gender and work, as textile work is strongly associated with women’s work, but the details of how this translates into workspace is very much contingent on social stratification and historical context. In terms of wool production in medieval Iceland, it was done at home and the whole household was involved at differ - ent stages of the raising of sheep, harvest of wool, production, and sale of the raw wool and finished product. 29 It is a good place to look for gendered use

of space, as cloths’ production, use, and exchange took place over most of the Icelandic farmstead, revealing useful information about what medieval people thought about appropriate gender norms and roles. The cloth vaðmál can be used as a productive alternative source for the study of medieval Icelandic history, for material culture can be used as a lens of inquiry into the gendered relations of production in this medieval society, working around the apparent bias and restrictions of traditional textual sources and finding past voices by reading the remnants of an important his - torical technology. Textiles affected all aspects of life, including the social, political, economic, and religious, and at all levels of society, therefore revealing crucial information about social relations, labour, and exchange. 30

The study of cloth thus allows for a more comprehensive history, allowing us to see how both genders worked and interacted together in their daily tasks and were not as definitively segregated as past scholarship imagines. The study of the production and use of cloth helps to envision a society, on a grander and more inclusive scale, of people living and working together in medieval Iceland.

Vaðmál and Relations of Production

Medieval Iceland was a subsistence, pastoral society that relied on animal husbandry and the import of other necessary supplies, as the landscape was not suited to extensive grain production. There were different types and sizes of farms, including independent farms or tenant farms, but all doing the same type of agricultural work. 31 The structure of this farming community changed over time, from stratified households of free farmers and slaves in the ninth to twelfth centuries, to the growth of tenancy from the twelfth to thirteenth centuries, with some farms becoming increasingly larger and wealthier than others and living off the excess production of lesser, dependent farms. 32

The household economy was essential to early Icelandic society’s survival, relying on the work of both men and women. A medieval Icelandic household was a conjugal household, that is, it was headed by the married husband and wife. The term for the household is hjón , but this term also refers to the house -

hold as a collective, the married couple, their children, and a few servants. 33 It could also include dependents such as extended family and fostered children of various ages and degrees of relation. 34 Farmstead work was done according to a seasonal schedule of work. 35 Bjarnar saga Hítdælakappa includes a poem that describes the size of Þórðr Kolbeinsson’s household and how until recently it ran smoothly:

Calm were sixteen servants, smoothly ran our household, each bow-wielder, wealth-Hlin, was at heart untroubled, till one haughty attacker of treasure, only lately manage to make uproar among our house’s people. 36

The entire household would work together as a complementary whole, and so a study of one facet of work on the farmstead needs to be inclusive of, or at least acknowledge, all those working on the farmstead who were involved in that area, including the processes of textile production. Indeed, when using the right approach, we can find women’s voices in a study of the archaeolog - ical investigations of the lived spaces of the medieval Icelandic farmstead. 37

There was a significant shift in animal husbandry practices in Iceland during the tenth century, which lasted until the late thirteenth century, and was directed towards an increased wool yield. The early settlers had brought their Northern European farming traditions with them to Iceland, continuing an agricultural tradition that relied heavily on rearing a variety of livestock, especially cattle and pigs, and less sheep and goats. This changed later as they relied more heavily on sheep and cattle, and hardly or not at all on pigs and goats. 38 These animals would be raised mainly for meat or milk, but also for animal by-products, such as wool. Early medieval farmers could be equally as

intentional in their farming strategies and landscape use as modern farmers, as they were deliberate in their choice of raising their sheep to be used for meat, milk, or by-products. The two basic goals, high yield of meat and milk or high yield of wool, require different approaches in farming practice. These approaches are determined by decisions concerning breeding, sex ratios of the flock, weaning age, grazing strategies, and the age of animal at time of slaughter, as an animal intended for meat or milk is weaned and slaughtered at a different age than an animal raised for wool. Jón Haukur Ingimundarson aptly describes the three different, deliberate phases used in raising Icelandic sheep to achieve either of these goals, using both ethnographic data of sheep farming in Iceland in the nineteenth century and archaeofaunal remains of medieval sheep (the study of animal bones in the archaeological record). From the settlement era, the main strategy was one that, as previously noted, relied on a variety of livestock, and used their wool, meat, and milk. There was a marked change that began in the tenth century as Icelandic farmers would cull lambs at an older age and the flock would have a high number of free-grazing wethers and a low number of well-fed ewes. This was done intentionally to promote a high wool yield, rather than pro - moting meat and milk production. 39 Saga evidence also supports the idea of free-grazing sheep, as Egils saga Skallagrímssonar mentions an industrious farmer who let his sheep roam the mountain pastures over the whole summer and remarked that those animals were in better health and fatter when they could range there, while Droplaugarsona saga mentions sheep being cared for over winter in a fenced field south of the hayfield wall where there were large stores of hay. 40 Ingimundarson’s study notes that this strategy changed in the late medieval period when farmers reverted back to the first strategy of a reliance on sheep’s milk and meat for sustenance. This shift in farming strategy demonstrates how woollen goods, particularly vaðmál , became an important staple good as the medieval Icelandic economy

39 Jón Haukur Ingimundarson, ‘Of Sagas and Sheep: Toward a Historical Anthropology of Social Change and Production for Market, Subsistence and Tribute in Early Iceland (10 th to the 13 th )’ (Unpublished PhD thesis, The University of Arizona, 1995), pp. 63, 66, 81, 96. Jón Haukur argues that we can know that these strategies were intentional for human consumption (meat and milk) or wool production because the second phase would have been more expensive. It would require feeding the ewes good quality fodder for a longer and more nutritious suckling period, which was costlier than letting the entire flock free-graze. It would also result in a higher proportion of wethers (castrated rams) to ewes because they would produce more wool than adult ewes. 40 Bernard Scudder (trans.), ‘Egil’s saga’, in Viðar Hreinsson (ed.), The Complete Sagas of Icelanders Including 49 Tales , 5 vols (Reykjavík, 1997), vol. 1, pp. 33–177, at p. 66; McTurk (trans.), ‘The Saga of Droplaug’s Sons’, p. 364.

became more reliant on wool, both domestically and internationally, with the peak occurring from the twelfth to thirteenth century, when wool developed into a commodity currency used in exchange and trade-in-kind domestically and also as the main export product shipped abroad. 41 It was essential to the Icelandic economy because it was traded in return for the import of much- needed foreign goods, such as grain and timber. It was valued abroad as a cheap cloth, before the Flemish cloth trade became dominant in the Northern European market. 42 Icelandic wool was valued because the dual-layered, long-haired coat of the sheep had high levels of lanolin (a kind of natural oil in the fleece) that made the woollen products wind- and water-resistant when fulled (washed to tighten the weave of the cloth). The production of this woollen cloth, vaðmál , involved the work of men and women in most areas of the farmstead, on all farms. It also involved year- round work, as reconstructive estimates guess that it would take a full eight months of work to produce enough textiles just for the household (bedding, clothing, and household goods), not including extras for sale or trade, which is estimated at 70–100 kg annually. 43 During the period of peak export, as men - tioned above, medieval Icelandic farmers had applied a deliberate farming strategy aimed to maximize wool yield and would have the wethers graze beyond the immediate area of the farmstead in highland pastures for most of their food during the milder months. The shepherding and care of the flock would be done by shepherds or farmhands, who could potentially be male or female, with the wethers being taken away from the enclosed home field to graze in the mountains and away from the farm at shieling sites to reserve the home field for harvesting for the ewes and for winter hay. 44

The production of cloth would then begin with pre-cloth phases of produc - tion, which was usually done by female household members, with the more mundane and simple work being done by servants or lower status women. The wool would be plucked from shedding sheep, as it was not sheared until later centuries. This wool would then be washed, sorted by grade, as it had a thicker outer layer and a finer inner layer, and then dyed. The wool would then be carded to align the fibres, spun to create threads, and then woven on

a warp-weighted upright loom. The particular form of woven woollen home - spun cloth used as a commodity currency, vaðmál , is identified by its 2/2 twill weave structure. This type of weave became the dominant type of woollen cloth produced in medieval Iceland. 45 The woven cloth would then be fulled in order to tighten the weave and enhance the wind- and water-resistant prop - erties of the cloth. Next it would be dyed, if it had not already been dyed at an earlier stage, and then would be sewn into the desired finished product, often clothing, sails, bedding, and sacks, among other uses, or it would be rolled up and stored as a bolt of cloth in a standard size to be exchanged, traded, or used at a later time. 46 Cloth was very valuable, as there was such a great time investment required in its production, and so it would be used, reused, and repurposed until it became rags, and then finally discarded. Archaeological remains of early farmsteads show that the spinning, weaving, and fulling stages of wool production were likely completed in smaller, external, semi-subterranean buildings. This changed in the eleventh century as these external buildings disappeared and instead the specialized stages of textile production were completed in annexes added to the main buildings. 47 There is also archaeological evidence suggesting that the style of the houses themselves changed during the twelfth to thirteenth century from bow-walled longhouses with a central hearth and several outbuildings, to narrower building complexes with straight walls and small rooms that branched off from the main hall and included raised fireplaces and kitchens. 48

The specialized activities of textile production increased in importance during this period, as cloth was transformed into a type of commodity currency, and were moved inside the house where it could be monitored more closely, and an increased volume of production in turn required larger spaces. Most of the stages involved in Icelandic wool production are, by their nature, transportable and easily done as by-work alongside other responsi - bilities, such as childcare and food preparation, and did not require dedicated space or special infrastructure. 49 This means that there did not need to be a

specific room dedicated for this work, apart from the weaving on the large warp-weighted loom. The loom would be confined to one spot for the duration of the weaving project. It could not be moved once the complex yarn system was set up, as this would alter the tension and affect the quality of the final product, and it would need to be protected from the elements and foot traffic. The saga literature includes a few accounts of dedicated space for textile production, such as the special weaving room ( vefjarstofa ) mentioned in Brennu-Njáls saga . 50 Other than references to weaving, most saga references to textile work are praise for a woman’s skill in needlework, not to specific stages of production. 51

The saga literature also mentions, in several accounts, areas of the house - hold which is referred to as a women’s bower or quarters, which was referred to as dyngja , skemma , or saumstofa . 52 This may perhaps be borrowing from examples in continental literature of women working in specialized and private chambers, where the architecture of estates was much larger and elab - orate or applying a later concept of space to an earlier period. There are saga accounts of women’s rooms, but also accounts of women working in areas accessible to, or in sight of, men. 53 Gísla saga Súrssonar mentions a women’s area in the hall at Hol, on the south side of the large fire-room, where Auðr and Ásgerðr sat sewing, but it was not an area private to women, as Ásgerðr’s husband overheard the women accusing each other of illicit activity and extra - marital affairs. 54 When compared to the archaeological evidence of farmstead structures, we can see more clearly what this may have meant for medieval Icelandic women and their daily work. There would be a limited number of

Sveinsson (ed.), Brennu-Njáls saga , Íslenzk fornrit 12 (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 132, 344. 51 A noteworthy exception is the skaldic poem Darraðarljóð , near the end of Brennu- Njáls saga , which gives a detailed account of twelve valkyries weaving on a supernatural loom on a battlefield. It transforms the imagery of female textile pro - duction into a violent masculine setting of a battlefield, as the valkyries decided the outcome of the battle through their weaving. The pieces of the loom and the textile tools are replaced with blood, body parts, and weapons; see Einar Ól.

rooms available to designate as these women’s quarters, and it is likely that this meant that there was a space for women to retreat to when the house had visitors and they wished to complete their daily activities, including textile work, away from the noise and hustle and bustle of guests, but not a specific workspace to which they were confined. The farmhouses of the earlier period, the longhouse, were simple structures with little extra private space to reserve solely for female use and specialized tasks could be moved to outbuildings. The later structures were more complex and had more rooms than the earlier houses, which potentially could be reserved as a workspace for females or for specialized craft work done by mixed sexes. Segregation into a separate space does not have to mean separation from the rest of the household, rather this was a separation from the public space inhabited by visitors and would be a place where the daily activities of women and male family members of all social strata could take place away from prying eyes or in a protected space, as access would have been controlled. The more private areas of the house would be found deeper in the home, as one would have to pass through the public space, through rooms and past people to get to this space. 55 This could be because it was used to store valuables away from visitors, store finished textiles products (which were valuable in themselves, as they were a commodity currency), keep a work-in-progress safe from any mishaps, or even to provide the worker some respite from the busyness of entertaining visitors. This use of space does not necessarily trans - late into a private, female domestic space, but rather space that had controlled access in order to protect the assets of the household. Once the vaðmál cloth was completed, the cloth became legal currency and was exchanged or traded at seasonal fairs and markets, assemblies, or with foreign merchants and used as payments in domestic transactions. Ljósvetninga saga tells of the Icelander Þórir Akraskeggr selling vaðmál cloaks to the ship owner Helgi in return for linen and other goods. 56 This cloth was also used to fund overseas journeys, and in such instances the cloth is referred to as fararefni , the funds or means used to travel abroad. Eyrbyggja saga has Þorleifr Kimbi taking three hundred ells of vaðmál and twelve vaðmál cloaks to fund his voyage abroad. 57 Ölkorfa þáttr includes a payment of compensation for burned woods, where Broddi had to pay each plaintiff six ells of vaðmál . 58 The vaðmál cloth here is clearly acting as a commodity

currency. It was used as the commodity standard until the fourteenth century, when skreið , dried fish, took its place as the main export item, but still contin - ued to be an important trade good for centuries after. 59

Woollen cloth was a key commodity currency in medieval Icelandic society, and it played an essential role in the export economy industry. Since women produced this cloth, this means that women were indirectly, but vitally, active in the medieval Icelandic economy, taking advantage of an abundantly availa - ble raw product (wool) and creating an economically viable product ( vaðmál ) available for credit or exchange in the domestic economy and traded in the international economy through foreign merchants. Through the study of the production of this essential cloth export product, vaðmál , we can see that many members of society were involved in its pro - duction, at various stages. It was a collaborative affair. This reveals important information about how this pastoral subsistence economy operated and how it rested on the backbone of household production, as the family household was the basic unit of society. The focus of medieval Icelandic gender and labour relations, therefore, should be directed towards the family and the interplay of men and women’s roles within the household. Indeed, promoting the status and wealth of the ætt , or family kinship group, was more important than respecting appropriate gender roles or individual motives. The sexual division of labour, which had general boundaries or norms, was, however, flexible and could be bent as labour needs required. Everyone in the household had to work together to shepherd the flocks, harvest the hay for winter fodder for the sheep producing the wool, and process the wool products, which were then exchanged and traded domestically and sold for external markets. Women, and everyone involved in this production, were literally producing money, weaving cloth as visible, tenable forms of currency.

The Icelandic Housewife: Power through Regulation of the Production of Money

As vaðmál woollen cloth was a key commodity currency and export item, quality assurance was crucial and its production was highly regulated so that it would be produced according to standard measurements, which were regulated by law. As this cloth currency was both produced in the home and used outside of the home in domestic and international exchange, regulation

required supervision by both the husband and wife as representatives of the public and private affairs of the household. This aspect, the important role of the housewife in regulating standardization, has not been fully addressed. In the aforementioned example of Helgi Akraskeggr selling cloaks to a trader, it turns out Helgi had sold poor quality cloth, old and full of holes, and this caused the captain to return to Iceland and he went to the chieftain Guðmundr, who took care of the legal case for Helgi. 60 Standardization in production was necessary because this cloth was used as a domestic currency that was exchanged in value for kind and by standard rates, which can be found in the medieval law codes. As it was intended for distant international markets, the product had to meet standard market requirements and be able to compete with similar local goods. A bolt of cloth was to be two ells in width (one ell is roughly the length of a man’s forearm). Grágás , the medieval Icelandic law code, set penalties for false measurements of vaðmál and stated that every burial church was to have a measurement stick for comparison in cases of dispute. 61 Furthermore, the exchange of inferior quality cloth was punishable with sentences as severe as outlawry, which meant that perpetra - tors would no longer be recognized as members of society but would stand outside societal protection. 62 This could have serious repercussions for the family and household of a man who sold cloth that did not meet standardiza - tion measures and was subsequently outlawed, leaving his household without his protection or support. The housewife would have most likely been in charge of ensuring that the cloth woven in her household followed legal regulations, so that her husband or other male family members would be able to trade and exchange the cloth. As the hjón was based on the marital partnership, the male and female heads of house were responsible for different aspects of the household. As the partner to her husband ( bóndi ) the housewife ( húsfreyja ) shared the responsibilities for running the household, a sort of symbiotic relationship of mutual benefit. Grágás prescribes that the wife was to manage the affairs within the threshold of the farmstead ( fyrir innan stokk ) and that the husband was to manage the affairs beyond the threshold of the farmstead ( fyrir útan stokk ), with these zones not necessarily corresponding to inside or outside the house itself. 63 These were complementary and interdependent gender roles,

as the shared concern in farm households was furthering the family’s social status through resource production and exchange, communal success rather than individual gain. The housewife gained her influence through the status and wealth of her husband, household, and family. This provided much agency for these women, as they could hold significant power and authority in their household. She was under the charge of her husband, but otherwise would manage the farm’s house - hold, inside and outside, acting as intermediary between her husband, home, and other dependants in their arrangement of mutual household obligation. 64 Such is the case, for example, of Droplaug in Fljótsdæla saga , and other many other wives in the Icelandic sagas who managed the daily affairs of their farmsteads in partnership with their husbands. An example of a successful partnership is the marriage of Hǫskuldr to Jórunn Bjarnardóttir: she took over management of the farm at Hǫskuldsstaðir ‘and assumed her duties in running the farm along with Hǫskuldr. She soon showed herself to be clever and experienced, and skilled at many things’. 65 As the medieval Icelandic economy relied on both agriculture and trade, the men of the household could be away from home for long periods of time and needed to rely on their marital partner to ensure that the farm continued to run properly, and there are many saga examples of wives doing this successfully. 66 Other examples have widowed mothers running the farmstead alongside sons and sisters with or in the absence of their brothers. 67

Women managed the essential labour of cloth production, spinning and weaving, on individual farm households, a shared space with little privacy and much interdependence. As previously mentioned, over time the sites of specialized textile production moved from small, external structures to the inside of the main building, where the production activities of other household members could be monitored more closely. This minor restructuring of the household architecture meant that these gendered spaces of production moved

deeper into the interior of the house, accessed only via the central living room, meaning that there was control of access and there was less disruption of these important daily tasks by foot traffic or loss due to theft. 68 As vaðmál cloth had become more important to the economy, greater attention to controlling standardization was needed, and this was done under the watchful eye of the housewife, as the manager responsible for the fyrir innan stokk . As vaðmál cloth was highly regulated in terms of standards of length, width, and durability, this required planning and strategy at all stages of production of this cloth. This means that decisions had to be made by the heads of household concerning not only strategies for raising sheep for high wool yields, but also decisions about what the finished cloth would look like before even starting production. Someone needed to know what the finished dimensions needed to be, and so how much total wool would be needed, how thick or hard to spin the weft or warp threads, what weaving pattern to use, and how high of a thread count. Ensuring quality is not just a matter of looking at the finished cloth and deciding if it meets the standards or not, it also requires planning and decisions before even starting to ensure that the finished product will meet those standards. As the head of the domestic sphere, the housewife would have been the overseer of the production of this cloth as money, supervising and guiding all the stages of textile production, including wool preparation, spinning, and weaving, that took place within the realm of the farmstead, in cooperation with her husband. The housewife can be seen as the locus of the domestic cloth production industry in medieval Iceland. She was the person that connected all the stages of cloth production and trade: the other women and dependants she supervised in the farming and production on the farmstead and also her husband and any mer - chants she may have interacted with after the cloth was finished and it became an official form of currency. Her husband would take the product to trade or exchange at seasonal gatherings, meetings, and harbour sites to trade with foreign merchants, as he was the one with access to outside markets beyond boundaries of the farmstead. The interaction between the different members of the household in the production, supervision, and regulation of vaðmál demon - strates how we should look at gender and labour roles as a web of contacts, stages of relations and connections, rather than as a divisive binary of appropri - ate roles for men and women. The Icelandic farmstead was an interdependent system that required all members of the household to work together for success, and the efficiency and quality of individuals’ activities affected the household output and potential to gain wealth or prestige through resource exchange.

Conclusion

This chapter has looked at a long period in the history of medieval Iceland. This was not, however, a static culture but one that transformed the role and position of women. As woollen cloth became more significant and valuable to economic activity, so did the housewife, who held the second highest status on the farmstead, next to her husband. The growth of the importance of vaðmál in the household, domestic, and international economy meant that she held an increasingly important position as the supervisor and quality controller of the production, by various members of her household, of this woollen cloth which was the most important export good until the fourteenth century and contin - ued to be an important export good until the eighteenth century. Without the cloth women produced, there would be significant effect on the import of the trade goods necessary for survival and Icelandic young men would not have the travel funds to go abroad and make their names in the world, earning wealth, fame, and honour in foreign courts which they would bring back to Iceland as monetary and social currency. Vaðmál can thus be used as a tool to see the important role medieval women played in their society and to under - stand how they were able to carve out a role and space for themselves in their medieval Icelandic world; the juxtaposition of a female-produced item in the male arena of commercial payments and trade shows the connection between the economy and daily life, that the internal, domestic household unit was important for the functioning of the external, national economy. Women’s work can, and did, play a crucial role in past economies, and this should be highlighted, rather than overlooked, as women’s labour has often been devalued in modern societies and not seen as important as waged labour to the functioning of the economy (even today). Work and waged labour only comes to define gender, women, and standards of femininity later with the creation of private and gendered spaces strongly associated with ideas of fem - inine virtue, appropriate labour roles, and the physical separation of family workspace into male and female workspaces. Reconnecting women and men’s work, connecting the so-called domestic and public spheres, demonstrates the symbiotic nature of labour and economy in medieval Icelandic society: the household functioned in solidarity with each other, with men and women having different, complementary, and important roles in society. Although images of people and daily life in the medieval Icelandic sagas have had great influence on modern literature and media, the image of Arya and Sansa Stark sewing enclosed in the seclusion of a tower room presented at the opening of this chapter does not reflect the rural, pastoral life of medieval Icelandic women. The physical space of the farmstead and the social structure does not support this notion of strictly separated spheres. The lack of an

WOMEN ’ S WORK AND MATERIAL CULTURE IN MEDIEVAL ICELAND

aristocratic class with large sums of disposable wealth meant that Iceland did not have the same expansive architecture as the great estates in continental Europe, and therefore could not enforce separation of space for male and female work in the same way, which even on the continent would have been rare and reserved for few of the wealthiest estates. While Iceland was connected to Europe and maintained active trade and cultural contact, Iceland was a unique and distinct society with its own cultural patterns and labour and gender norms. Considering the modern valorisation of the strong female character rebel - ling against traditional gender norms, as reflected in the popularity of charac - ters such as Arya Stark, there is a clear concern for finding women’s voices in the past, making space for women and searching for examples of equality and power. Yet representations of such medieval-type female characters miss the important function of women in traditional roles in the past, especially in the household. There needs to be room for the valorisation of women in more traditional spaces and this can be done without villainizing traditionally female things for the sake of present norms and values. Whether in fantasy literature or in scholarship, we should be careful not to write women who are only strong because they act like men, but who are strong on their own terms, and in a way that does not denigrate femininity. If we see Sansa Stark as the epitome of the feminine in Game of Thrones , we can praise her character for what she was able to accomplish over the course of the television series: surviving and playing a significant role to the plot despite her seemingly weak status as a woman. It is interesting that whereas textile work has been posited as boring and restrictive in modern fantasy works, it has clearly positive associations when we look at the example of woollen cloth production in medieval Iceland. In this context, women’s activities were vital to the economy, social relations, and politics. Woollen cultural products were woven by women in the home, a traditionally female-associated space, to be used by men in activities such as trade and compensation payments in traditionally male-associated public spaces such as markets and assemblies. These activities are not always explicit in the male-authored saga literature, but we can overcome that by using alternate sources and by redirecting the focus of our inquiry to better understand the less visible areas of the past. In peeling apart the layers of bias, misogynist attitudes, and imaginative reconstructions coming from the manuscript writers and modern scholars, we can reveal the voices of these women, as discovered here through the example of women’s work in vaðmál production. Studying textiles allows us to discover women who held an active and important position in society and who did not need to act like men to be valued.
