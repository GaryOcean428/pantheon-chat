## Foreword:


## Old Norse and the Porous


## Boundaries of Medievalism
Tom Shippey

The dominant ideology of the modern world is that of progress: most obviously, scientific and technological, but also economic (the quest for growth), and polit - ico-cultural (the use of legislation to improve society and alter cultural attitudes for the better). In these circumstances, it is natural that the past should be regarded as inferior, and in particular the medieval past. ‘Medieval’ is routinely used in pejorative senses. Often quoted is the remark in the 1994 movie Pulp Fiction , ‘I’m gonna get medieval on yo’ ass’: it means, ‘I am going to use torture’. One could cite also the old and bitterly satirical song by Tom Lehrer, 1 ‘In the land of the boll-weevil / Where the laws are medieval’: i.e., cruel and savage. Yet at the same time, the medieval world retains a powerful attraction, as seen in several recent successful TV series: George Martin’s Game of Thrones , with its knights and contending dynasties in a world one might call ‘high medieval’; Vikings , which gives a much-foreshortened picture of an era stretching from the eighth to the eleventh centuries; and The Last Kingdom , based on the novels of Bernard Cornwell and more firmly set in the late ninth and early tenth centuries. One could argue that the attraction of such series stems indeed from their regressive cruelty, much more stimulating than peace and tranquillity. But the medieval world has also had powerful defenders, who point out that in the past century the modern world has had nothing to boast of as regards civilised behaviour. T.H. White’s indignant outburst in The Once and Future King 2 – ‘The Dark and Middle Ages! The Nineteenth Century had an impudent way with its labels’ – is extended to the twentieth century by C.S. Lewis’s diabolical narrator Screwtape, who gloats over the way the

achievements of the Enlightenment have been reversed. 3 In political terms, the medieval has also again and again been used as a source of legitimacy, deliberately invoked by nation-builders in earlier centuries, and by separa - tist and irredentist movements up to the present day: this particular danger remains one for the future as well. 4

The medieval, in other words, is deeply involved with the modern. It is no longer, if it ever was, a ‘safe space’ for purely academic study. It has become, as perhaps it always was, a ‘contested site’. The importance of medievalism as an academic discipline – a relatively novel academic discipline – as the editors to this volume point out, is precisely that it considers both the object of study and the diffracting lenses with which that study is carried out. This process involves, in the sequence given here, reflection, reconsid - eration, and roads out, or roads to the present. These essays invite us to re-read medieval works in a way contrary to their surface meaning, or more accurately, to the ways in which they have conventionally been interpreted. In ‘Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in Medieval Iceland: Saga Realism and the Sworn Brothers’, Ármann Jakobsson takes on the especially provocative case of The Saga of the Sworn Brothers , with its dual heroes, poet Þormóðr and psychopath Þorgeirr, so challenging to modern sensibilities that it was rewrit - ten parodically by Halldór Laxness, in 1952 as Gerpla : 5 Ármann suggests that this saga needs a psychological interpretation of a kind not normally extended to medieval narratives. Similarly, in ‘The Malleability of the Past: Íslendingabók as Narrative History’, Martina Ceolin approaches a venerated text in Íslendingabók , a foundational work for the Icelandic republic, and argues that it needs to be considered in the light of the author’s ‘ideological parameters’. In ‘Women’s Work and Material Culture in Medieval Iceland: Gender, Narrative, and Cloth Production’, Meghan Korten likewise points out how the ‘gendered division of labour’ – presented with reference to literary depictions in Icelandic sagas, archaeological evidence, and a revealing scene in Game of Thrones – disguises a very different reality in medieval Icelandic households (and likely across much of Europe). Norse myth in particular has become both a part of the modern world’s ‘mental furniture’ and a powerful stimulus for just such resistant readings – of which one might note several in the last few years alone, all by popular and

3 In ‘Screwtape Proposes a Toast’, a 1959 addition to C.S. Lewis, The Screwtape Letters (London, 1942). 4 The best overall guide to this process is Joep Leerssen, National Thought in Europe: A Cultural History (Amsterdam, 2006). 5 First English translation, The Happy Warriors , trans. Katherine John (London, 1958), later (with a less ironic title) as Wayward Heroes , trans. Philip Roughton (Brooklyn, NY, 2016).

FOREWORD : OLD NORSE AND THE POROUS BOUNDARIES OF MEDIEVALISM

respected authors: A.S. Byatt’s Ragnarok (2011), Joanne Harris’s The Gospel of Loki (2014) and The Testament of Loki (2018), and Neil Gaiman’s Norse Mythology (2016), as well as his earlier American Gods (2001). One has always to remember the often-complex chain of transmission by which these myths, poems, and images were brought into the modern world. In ‘ Vafþrúðnismál from Parchment to Print: Stability and Change in the Transmission of Eddic Poetry’, Andrew McGillivray traces one such chain, from vellum to paper to print, in the case of a single poem. Quite how complex the chain will become once digital transmission has become normative is, perhaps, unforeseeable. In Vafþrúðnismál , the giant Vafþrúðnir and the god Óðinn stake their heads on a contest of wisdom, in which the latter triumphs as the wisest of all beings. Quite why the figure of Óðinn the Wanderer should be so familiar to us and so readily seized on is illuminatingly discussed by Ryan E. Johnson in ‘The Odinic Motif: The Wanderer in the Mist’, with regard both to medieval sagas and modern fictions. The role of transformation in Odinic myth is the focus of Dustin Geeraert’s ‘What has Darwin to do with Óðinn? Shapeshifting, God and, Nature in the “Great Story of the North”’, particularly in retellings by William Morris and J.R.R. Tolkien. One thing certain is that interpretations of the medieval have long since escaped from any possibility of academic control. In ‘Madness, Mythology, Mitteleuropa: Günter Grass’s Transformation of Old Norse Myth in The Tin Drum ’, Heather O’Donoghue looks back on the abuse of ‘ancestral heritage’ in political ideology – though her example also shows a powerful response to that in Gunter Grass’s The Tin Drum . Abuse can be countered by use, and reading by resistant reading. In ‘Once More, with Fiction: Transforming Myth in Gerður Kristný’s Blóðhófnir and the Eddic Poem Skírnismál ’, Christopher Crocker likewise emphasizes the importance of such readings. In this article, Crocker refers to a suggestion made by Oren Falk:

although the boundary between creative, fictional responses to Old Norse literature and culture, on the one hand, and responsible, fact-based schol - arly analysis, on the other, must be maintained, Oren Falk posits that the porous nature of this same boundary can also be ‘leveraged as a source of understanding’.

One can add only that that is not the only boundary which is porous! Creative writers can be fact-based, and (alas) scholarly analyses have often been irre - sponsible. In the contested site of medievalism, one can only recommend the kind of detailed and if necessary, contrarian studies which this volume provides.
