## Stability and Change in the Transmission


## of Eddic Poetry
Andrew McGillivray

The Lay of Vafþrúðnir ( Vafþrúðnismál ) is a myth, seven-hundred and fifty years old in its oldest manuscript form, and its story tells us about the wisdom contest between the Norse god Óðinn and the Norse giant Vafþrúðnir. Óðinn is victorious over his opponent, and the death of Vafþrúðnir is one of the most important things we know about him, for it marks the climax of the mythic text bearing his name. Also important is his vast knowledge of the cosmos, its past, present, and future, that he imparts to Óðinn and the audience. This important myth is only related in full in this one poem, though fragments of it are found in a few other textual witnesses. Some of the most central stories of Old Norse mythology are presented in the dialogic exchange between the god and the giant. My aim is to explore this myth’s rich transmission history in order to highlight the recontextualization process that has occurred with each major change in medium it has gone through. Vafþrúðnismál ’s textual history begins with skin manuscripts (i.e., parchment or vellum), carries through the early modern paper manuscript tradition in which it has a varied yet stable transmission, and it is now found in many print editions, the most recent Icelandic edition with a full scholarly apparatus dating to 2014, published in the Íslenzk fornrit text series. The present era is another age of transformation for Vafþrúðnismál , as the myth and many narratives like it arrive in the digital age, an arrival marked by the 2019 publication of the facsimile, diplomatic, and normalized texts of the Codex Regius manuscript of eddic poetry in the Editiones Arnamagnæanæ Electronicæ digital texts series. What follows is thus a tracing of how Vafþrúðnismál has arrived at the present, belonging as it does to a stable narrative tradition that practices careful reproduction of manuscripts and preparation of critical editions. Variation has persisted, however, and adjustments have accompanied each material transition

VAFÞRÚÐNISMÁL , FROM PARCHMENT TO PRINT

from parchment to paper to print. In modern critical interpretations and artistic creations inspired by the myth, the many Old Norse cosmic myths represented in Vafþrúðnismál continue to find new life and undergo further recontextualiza - tion, a process facilitated by the careful hands of scribes, publishers, and transla - tors over the centuries who have made it possible for modern interpreters to read this medieval text and many like it. Changes in context at each stage challenge new audiences to reinterpret previous meanings, and so understanding how this poem has appeared at different times, in its many representations, can help us to more clearly understand the significance of medieval texts through time. 1 The changes that occurred as the poem has been set in print are the most important for us in the present, for the careful making of scholarly and popular editions in the nineteenth century standardized how medieval texts are presented to modern audiences, and therefore modern readers have been given a particular set of lenses through which to view medieval legacies.

Earliest Witnesses

Vafþrúðnismál is found in full in the Icelandic manuscript often referred to as the Codex Regius manuscript of eddic poetry (GKS 2365 4to; R), 2

now housed at the Árni Magnússon Institute (Árnastofnun) in Reykjavík,

1 Criticism of Vafþrúðnismál is emerging as an important category within Old Norse poetics. See the recent article by Pierre-Brice Stahl, ‘L’énigme d’inversion dans la littérature médiévale scandinave’, Revue de l’histoire des religions , 229:3 (2016), 329–42. Another important study has been carried out by Jón Karl Helgason, ‘Omkring Snorres poetikk. Skaldskapens rolle í Vafþrúðnismál og Snorra Edda ’, in Jon Gunnar Jørgensen (ed.), Snorres Edda i europeisk og islandsk kultur (Reykholt, 2009), pp. 107–30. The most influential studies to date are those by Ármann Jakobsson, ‘A Contest of Cosmic Fathers: God and Giant in Vafþrúðnismál’, Neophilologus , 92 (2007), 263–77, and John McKinnell, Both One and Many: Essays in Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism, with an Appendix by Maria Elena Ruggerini (Rome, 1994). These studies analyse the myth or an aspect of it along with the medi - eval context of the poem, whereas the present study focuses on the poem’s transmis - sion. For an in-depth narrative analysis of Vafþrúðnismál , see Andrew McGillivray, Influences of Pre-Christian Mythology and Christianity on Old Norse Poetry: A Narrative Study of Vafþrúðnismál (Kalamazoo, 2018). 2 4to is an abbreviation for ‘Quarto manuscript format’, which refers to a man - uscript’s size as determined by the folding process. Each leaf in R is 194mm x 134mm in size, and the R manuscript is made up of forty-five leaves (or folios) in six gatherings (or quires). The first five gatherings have eight leaves each, and the final gathering has five leaves. One whole gathering (i.e., eight leaves) has been lost from the middle of the manuscript, resulting in a gap between leaves 32 and 33, where the missing gathering would have been.

Iceland. The original date for the composition of this manuscript is estab - lished to be c. 1270, and it is believed to be a copy made from two earlier collections of poetry from c. 1240, which were in turn likely copies of two or more older manuscripts, none of which could have been older than c. 1200. The two groupings of poems in the R manuscript, the eleven mythological poems which come first and the eighteen heroic poems that follow, were thus likely two separate collections that a scribe brought together, marking an early and important contextualization process for eddic poetry. 3 Vafþrúðnismál is the third poem in the manuscript, coming after Völuspá and Hávamál and before Grímnismál . These first four poems all feature Óðinn performing some activity in relation to knowledge. All poems in the R manuscript are composed in eddic poetic metres, in par - ticular in the fornyrðislag eddic metre and the ljóðaháttr eddic metre. Vafþrúðnismál is a dialogic ljóðaháttr poem. 4

The Icelandic manuscript AM 748 I a 4to (A) dates from c. 1300 and it preserves the texts of five eddic poems that are also found in R, three of which are incomplete in A, as well as the only medieval text of the eddic poem Baldrs draumar . The first text in the manuscript is an incomplete version of Hárbarðsljóð , a poem that features Óðinn and Þórr engaged in a battle of wits. The next poem is Baldrs draumar , a poem that also features Óðinn in a knowledge-seeking role, particularly like Völuspá and not unlike Vafþrúðnismál . After Baldr has woken from troubling dreams, the gods decide that Óðinn will travel to Hel to inquire about the meaning of the dreams, and, as in Völuspá and Vafþrúðnismál , Óðinn learns about the

Both fornyrðislag and ljóðaháttr , the primary eddic meters, have less-common variants: fornyrðislag has as its variant form málaháttr , a more relaxed meter generally, in which more syllables, both stressed and unstressed, are permitted; ljóðaháttr has as its variant form galdralag , in which there is a repetition of self-alliterating verses. The term ‘eddic’ derives from ‘edda’ (see note 7 below). For a detailed description of eddic meter, see Diana Whaley, ‘Introduction’, in Diana Whaley (ed.), Poetry from the Kings’ Sagas 1: From Mythical Times to c. 1035 , Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages 1 (Turnhout, 2012), pp. cxliii–ccxv, at pp. ccviii–ccx; for a more comprehensive analysis, see Seiichi Suzuki, The Meters of Old Norse Eddic Poetry: Common Germanic Inheritance and North Germanic Innovation , Ergänzungsbände zum Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde 86 (Berlin, 2014).

future and also about the imminent death of Baldr, an event that will have dire consequences for the gods, although it is likely that in Vafþrúðnismál , Baldr has already died. Like Vafþrúðnir, the character with whom Óðinn speaks in Baldrs draumar unmasks the god near to the end of the poem. Next in A is a partial version of Skírnismál , containing stanzas 1 through 27, but the remainder of the poem as it appears in R is not there, for there is a missing leaf at this place in the first gathering of the manuscript and pre - sumably Skírnismál would have continued. The final two-thirds of the text of Vafþrúðnismál follows, the portion of the poem during which Óðinn, dis - guised as Gagnráðr (Gangráðr in A), questions Vafþrúðnir. The first third of the poem is missing as a result of the lost leaf, but other than the incomplete nature of the poem as it appears in A, there is little difference in the part of the poem that remains in A from the complete version found in R. After Vafþrúðnismál there are complete texts of Grímnismál and Hymiskviða , the latter a poem in which Þórr and Týr travel from Ásgarðr to steal the giant Hymir’s cauldron. Finally, a fragment of the prose introduction to Völundarkviða concludes the mythological material in A, though it is a poem that is more heroic in content than mythological. In both the R and A manuscripts, Vafþrúðnismál is found alongside Grímnismál , indicating that in the parchment tradition these two poems form a pair, 5 and in both cases Vafþrúðnismál is placed before Grímnismál , perhaps serving as an introduction to it. Vafþrúðnismál provides a tempo - ral history of the Old Norse mythological cosmos, giving details from the past, the present, and the future, whereas Grímnismál provides details on the spatial dimensions of the cosmos, naming many of its inhabitants, places, and things. Although fragmentary, A provides an alternative ordering for some eddic poems, demonstrating that the arrangement of the poems in R was not the only possible ordering of the mythological eddic poems in parchment. This example is important, as emphasis has been placed on the prominent position of Vafþrúðnismál as the third poem in R, coming immediately after Völuspá and Hávamál , 6 but as the ordering in one of the two oldest manuscripts is quite different the significance of the placement in the other must be questioned. Together the two manuscripts provide the most com - prehensive and detailed context for a study of Vafþrúðnismál as we find it among texts of the same genre in medieval manuscripts.

Vafþrúðnismál is found in another type of medieval manuscript. Snorra Edda , a work that is attributed to the Icelandic chieftain Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241) and often referred to as The Prose Edda , is a mythological work that preserves stanzas of eddic poetry embedded in its narrative as quotations. 7 Any discus - sion of eddic poetry that looks at its mythological context must therefore take Snorra Edda into consideration, and, in our case, nine stanzas or partial stanzas of Vafþrúðnismál are cited in the section of the work titled Gylfaginning . 8 The three medieval parchment manuscripts that preserve Snorra Edda are the Codex Upsaliensis (DG 11 4to) from c. 1300, the Codex Regius of Snorra Edda (GKS 2367 4to) from sometime during the first half of the fourteenth century, and the Codex Wormianus (AM 242 fol.) 9 from the second half of the fourteenth century. 10 These three manuscripts are the most complete medieval versions of Snorra Edda that can be traced back to the fourteenth century or earlier. There were, however, fragments of Snorra Edda preserved in other parchment manuscripts and many later redactions. Therefore, these three examples are not

7 The meaning of the term ‘edda’, as it appears in the title of Snorra Edda in the Codex Upsaliensis manuscript (c. 1300), is unknown even though the term appears several times in medieval Icelandic texts. References in fourteenth-century skaldic poems, and later in rímur , indicate that the term was understood to mean something like ‘poetics’. In the eddic poem Rígsþula , preserved only in the Codex Wormianus manuscript (c. 1350), the term ‘Edda’ appears to mean ‘great-grandmother’, and ‘edda’ appears in some manuscripts of Skáldskaparmál among heiti for women. ‘Edda’ also appears as a personal name in Bósa saga (c. fourteenth century) without any clear association to the name of the book (i.e., Snorra Edda ), to the lists of heiti in Skáldskaparmál , or to Rígsþula . For a theory on the meaning of ‘edda’ in the context of Snorra Edda , see Anthony Faulkes, ‘Edda’, Gripla , 2 (1977), 32–9. Snorri Sturluson, it should be noted, is only named as author of the work in the Codex Upsaliensis manuscript of Snorra Edda . 8 John McKinnell, Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend (Cambridge, 2005), p. 45. The title Gylfaginning , like the attribution of authorship to Snorri Sturluson (see note 7 above), only appears in the Codex Upsaliensis manuscript. 9 fol. is an abbreviation for ‘Folio manuscript format’, which refers to the man - uscript’s size as determined by the folding process. The leaves of the Codex Wormianus are 280mm x 202mm in size. For more on this manuscript, see Handrit. is https://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/en/AM02-0242 [accessed 20 May 2021]. 10 These three medieval manuscripts of Snorra Edda survive along with a paper manuscript from the late sixteenth century, preserved in the University Library in Utrecht, Holland, known as the Codex Trajectinus (Traj 1374) and believed to be a copy from a now-lost parchment manuscript from the thirteenth century. See Willem van Eeden Jr., ‘Introduction’, in Willem van Eeden Jr. (ed.), De Codex Trajectinus van de Snorra Edda (Leiden, 1913), pp. i–cxxvi, 3–7, at pp. v, 3; see also Anthony Faulkes, ‘Introduction’, in Anthony Faulkes (ed.), Codex Trajectinus.

the only sources, but they are the oldest and most complete versions of the work, and it is likely there were even more fragments of Vafþrúðnismál in manuscripts that have perished over time. 11

Gylfaginning ( The Tricking of Gylfi ) is a collection of Old Norse myth - ological stories and bits of mythological information set into a frame nar - rative involving Óðinn and representations of him. These myths were most likely brought together in this way for the first time in this work, though they might have existed in a variety of oral forms prior to the composi - tion of Gylfaginning . 12 Regardless of whether the author’s sources were written or oral, the narratives of some eddic poems, particularly Völuspá and Vafþrúðnismál , share much in common with Gylfaginning , including a vision of the cosmos, concern for knowledge, and the Odinic figure as interrogator. The fragments of Vafþrúðnismál which are preserved within Gylfaginning are strikingly similar to the corresponding text as it is preserved in the R and A manuscripts, suggesting that either the poem existed in much the same form c. 1220 (the generally accepted date for Snorri’s composition of Snorra Edda ) as it did c. 1270 and later, or that the fragments that are preserved in Gylfaginning were adjusted at some point between the time of composition, c. 1220, and the appearance of Snorra Edda in surviving manuscripts some seventy years later and thereafter. The frame narrative of Gylfaginning is similar to that of Vafþrúðnismál . The guest in Gylfaginning , Gylfi, arrives as a disguised visitor with the name Gangleri (a heiti or nickname for Óðinn) at a hall and asks to come inside so he may engage with his intended host or hosts in an activity that has to do with knowledge. In both the poem and the prose narrative, it is the guest who asks most or all of the questions, and thus receives most of the knowledge. The three gods in Gylfaginning , or their representatives, Hár, Jafnhár, and Þriði (High, Just-as-High, and Third) answer Gylfi’s ques - tions about the origins, geography, major events, and future of the cosmos. Vafþrúðnismál not only plays an important role in Gylfaginning , in that the two narratives share structural attributes, and the poem is clearly a source for the prose text, but in one manuscript, the Codex Regius of Snorra Edda , Vafþrúðnir is even named. 13

One striking difference between the frame narratives of Vafþrúðnismál and Gylfaginning , however, is that in the eddic poem it is the guest who gets the better of his host, resulting in Vafþrúðnir’s death, whereas in Gylfaginning the gods or their representatives (Hár, Jafnhár, and Þriði) do not die when they are unable to answer Gylfi’s final question, but rather they disappear, and leave Gylfi as the one who has been tricked:

Því næst heyrði Gangleri dyni mikla hvern veg frá sér, ok leit út á hlið sér. Ok þá er hann sésk meir um, þá stendr hann úti á sléttum velli, sér þá ønga hǫll ok ønga borg. Gengr hann þá leið sína braut ok kemr heim í ríki sitt ok segir þau tíðindi er hann hefir sét ok heyrt. Ok eptir honum sagði hverr maðr ǫðrum þessar sǫgur. 14

(Next Gangleri heard loud noises coming at him from all directions. He looked to one side and, when he looked back again, he was standing outside on a level plain, where he saw neither the hall nor the fortress. He left and travelled back home to his kingdom, where he told of the events that he had seen and what he had heard. And after him, people passed these stories down from one to the other.) 15

In both Gylfaginning and Vafþrúðnismál , the hosts are unable to provide any more information and the final questions go unanswered, but in the former the gods are able to use their paranormal abilities to leave Gylfi alone, á sléttum velli , whereas Vafþrúðnir succumbs to his fate:

Ey manni þat veit, hvat þú í árdaga sagðir í eyra syni; feigum munni mælta ek mína forna stafi ok um ragna røk. 16

Jónas Kristjánsson and Vésteinn Ólason print Vafþrúðnismál in fifty-six stanzas, a deviation from the traditional division of the poem into fifty-five stanzas. The only difference is that Vafþrúðnir’s final stanza of speech is rather long, and while traditionally considered one lengthy stanza of ljóðaháttr , the Íslenzk fornrit editors break it into two stanzas, with stanza fifty-six as a half-stanza.

VAFÞRÚÐNISMÁL , FROM PARCHMENT TO PRINT

(No man knows what you said in bygone days into your son’s ear; with doomed mouth I’ve spoken my ancient lore about the fate of the gods.) 17

And, knowing his end is imminent, the giant continues:

Nú ek við Óðin deildak mína orðspeki; þú ert æ vísastr vera. 18

(I’ve been contending with Óðinn in words of wisdom; you’ll always be the wisest of beings.) 19

It is important, however, to remember the frame in which Gylfi’s visit to the gods takes place. Early in the story the following is narrated as Gylfi is travelling to Ásgarðr: ‘En Æsir váru því vísari at þeir hǫfðu spádóm, ok sá þeir ferð hans fyrr en hann kom, ok gerðu í móti honum sjónhverfingar’ 20

(But the Æsir, because they had the gift of prophecy, were the wiser in such matters. Before his arrival they foresaw his coming and, in preparation for him, they conjured up visual illusions). 21 Thus the whole of the encounter in Gylfaginning is the result of a paranormal spell that the gods control, 22

whereas Vafþrúðnir succumbs to the rules of the contest that he set in the first place, for although a learned giant, he does not have the wisdom of the Æsir. In chapter 2 of Gylfaginning , 23 Gylfi arrives at Valhöll under the name Gangleri and is brought inside the hall. Once Gylfi meets the three-fold host or hosts, Hár invites the guest to drink and eat, but Gangleri replies he will first ask them questions to see if there is a wise man among them. This is like Óðinn’s arrival at Vafþrúðnir’s hall when Vafþrúðnir invites him to enter further, but in the eddic poem the guest says that he will remain on the floor of the hall, and indeed he must undergo some preliminary questions from the giant. Gylfi, however, questions his hosts from the outset. To Gylfi’s initial statement that he will ask them some questions, Hár replies that the guest

will not leave the hall unless he grows wiser during his visit. Hár’s response is a confident challenge and there is a notable similarity at this point between Gylfaginning chapter 2 and Vafþrúðnismál stanza 7, at which point Vafþrúðnir states that if the guest is not as wise as the host, then he will not leave his hall alive. In Gylfaginning , matters are further complicated as all four speaking characters are figurations of Óðinn, the three Odinic hosts, and the Odinic guest Gylfi-Gangleri. The questions and answers continue, and in chapter 5 Gylfi asks about the origins of life, specifically of the races that inhabit the world. From his hosts Gylfi hears about the Ginnungagap from which the ancestor of the frost giants, Ymir (a.k.a. Aurgelmir), originates. It is also said that Ymir and all of his descendants are evil, and that from his own body were born his offspring, in fact from his own sweat. It is clear that the giants are even older than the gods, indeed they are their ancestors, and Vafþrúðnismál stanzas 30 and 31 are quoted in this chapter, used as evidence to corroborate the explanation that has been provided to Gangleri. The next reference to Vafþrúðnismál comes in Gylfaginning chapter 7, in which the Odinic hosts tell their guest how the sons of Bor (Óðinn and his brothers Vili and Vé) killed Ymir, and how from the flow of the giant’s blood all but one of the frost giants were killed. Bergelmir and his wife escaped on a wooden box, a lúðr , and they are the ancestors of the frost giants. Stanza 35 of Vafþrúðnismál is referenced at this point to corroborate the myth. The next reference to Vafþrúðnismál appears in chapter 18, when Gangleri asks from where the wind comes. Hár replies that a giant named Hræsvelgr sits at the northern edge of the world in the shape of an eagle and beats his wings and from this motion comes the wind, and stanza 37 of the poem is quoted as ref - erence. Later, in chapter 41 Gangleri asks about what activities the einherjar (Óðinn’s fallen warriors) engage in to occupy themselves when they are not drinking in Valhöll. Hár replies that every day they go outside into the court - yard and battle each other, returning home afterwards. Here Vafþrúðnismál stanza 41 is quoted. It is at this point, in both narratives, that events are moving towards the mythic future and to the events of Ragnarök. In chapter 51 of Gylfaginning , Gangleri asks about Ragnarök and what there is to be said about it. Hár replies that there is much to be said about Ragnarök and a quotation from Völuspá stanza 44 is given. More events are related by Hár and nine more stanzas from Völuspá provided, somewhat fragmented versions of stanzas 45 through 55, and then to finish the chapter Vafþrúðnismál stanza 18 is given, a description of the field (Vígríðr) where the final battle of Ragnarök will take place. The final verse quotations from Vafþrúðnismál appear in Gylfaginning chapter 53, where Gangleri asks about what will come after Ragnarök, which gods will survive, and what will happen to the earth

Hár replies by quoting Vafþrúðnismál stanza 51 about the gods that survive, and then Vafþrúðnismál stanza 45 about the survival of humankind, and finally Vafþrúðnismál stanza 47 about the emergence of the daughter of the sun who will take her mother’s place in the sky. This is as far into the future as can be foretold and the hosts then disappear. It is appropriate that these final verse quotations from Vafþrúðnismál focus on the regeneration and rebirth of the world after Ragnarök, for that is a prom - inent theme in the poem and in the Old Norse mythological eschatology, sug - gesting a cyclical representation of time with the return of the sun, the moon, and the seasons. In the medieval period, this cyclical view was merging with the more linear structure of temporality under the influence of Christianity. 24

In both Gylfaginning and Vafþrúðnismál , the cosmological knowledge is conveyed within the question-and-answer framework; the structures of these works are the method by which the thematic shape of the temporal cosmos is presented, and it is therefore no coincidence that the two narratives are so closely aligned in form, content, and ethos. 25

The two eddic poetry manuscripts and the three Snorra Edda manuscripts represent the earliest textual context of Vafþrúðnismál in parchment that has survived, and as has been shown the texts included in these manuscripts are woven together. If more parchment manuscripts had survived, we would cer - tainly know more, but as modern observers we must work with what we have, and the likelihood that manuscripts have been lost over the centuries is very high. With the emergence of the paper manuscript tradition, the context of the poem’s transmission changed, and there are many more versions of the text. 26

Though the medieval transmission history shows consistency in the poem’s earliest context, the appearance of quotations of Vafþrúðnismál in Snorra Edda demonstrates that from the beginning there is important variation in the presentation of medieval mythological material.

The Codex Trajectinus presents the contents of a fourth medieval manuscript of Snorra Edda , offering us a further example of how eddic poetry was used as corroborating evidence in mythography by at least one medieval author (see note 10 above).

Paper Manuscripts

Vafþrúðnismál appears in a wide range of paper manuscripts from the early modern period, and it is important to address several of them here, noting trends in how and where the poem was preserved. Even though medieval parchment versions are extant, the poem’s transmission continued to be an ongoing and increasingly variable process. What follows is a sample of the diversification of the text’s transmission on paper. AM 738 4to is a paper manuscript of mixed contents from c. 1680 and it is one-hundred and thirty-five leaves in length. Between leaves 45 and 79 are several mythological eddic poems appearing in the same order as they do in R: Völuspá , parts of Hávamál , then Vafþrúðnismál and Grímnismál , followed by other mythological eddic poems, all of which are R poems found in their original order. After this, however, Vegtamskviða (i.e., Baldurs draumar ) appears, a poem that is not in R, then Alvíssmál , an R poem, followed by four poems that do not appear in R: Grottasöngur , Grógaldur , Fjölsvinnsmál , and finally Hyndluljóð . 27 In this manuscript, the mythological poems of R are gathered together with other mythological eddic poems, showing that during this period, as in the earlier period, there is continuity in the effort to collect related materials together, an impulse that continues to this day, and fur - thermore the collection of related materials was diversifying. Following the mythological poems are Sólarljóð and ‘Gest speki’ (i.e., Heiðreks gátur ), the Gestumblindi episode from Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks . Perhaps what is most interesting about this manuscript is that just before the eddic poems, a number of illustrations of mythological content are found, beginning at leaf 33, which has images of Óðinn and Frigg, through leaf 43, which has an illustration of the world tree, Yggdrasill. In between these leaves are several illustrations of the gods and goddesses of the Norse pantheon and the monsters they battle against, and there is also an image of Valhöll, one of Óðinn’s many homes. 28

AM 747 4to is another paper manuscript from the seventeenth century that includes Snorra Edda , grammatical treatises, Rígsþula , and Vafþrúðnismál . The first fifty-four leaves are an assortment of passages from Snorra Edda , followed by eight leaves of grammatical treatises, then Rígsþula , and then the first forty-five verses of Vafþrúðnismál . After this incomplete version of

VAFÞRÚÐNISMÁL , FROM PARCHMENT TO PRINT

the poem, there is a final passage from Snorra Edda to conclude the manu - script. 29 Rígsþula does not appear in R or A, and thus this grouping of texts is unique in that Vafþrúðnismál is preserved alongside texts that are different from those it was preserved alongside during its transmission in parchment manuscripts, representing a further widening of the scope of materials col - lected together as centuries passed. This can lead to two possible conclusions: either some parchment manuscripts that did in fact present Vafþrúðnismál alongside more mixed contents have not survived, or, more likely, as the poem travelled further along the road to modernity, the contexts in which the poem appears widen. AM 164 8vo 30 is a paper manuscript that preserves Vafþrúðnismál with other eddic poems, skaldic poetry, and prose works. This seventeenth-cen - tury manuscript is eighty-three leaves in length and begins with forty-five leaves of Laufás-Edda, a systematic redaction of Snorra Edda , 31 followed by Vafþrúðnismál , Völuspá , Alvíssmál , and finally Skírnismál . All four of the eddic poems appear in R, but in a different order. Following the group of eddic poems is a Latin-Icelandic glossary, the dream verses from Gísla saga Súrssonar , then more skaldic verses from sagas of Icelanders and part of Heiðreks gátur . Notably, as with AM 738 4to (see above), Vafþrúðnismál is here preserved in the same manuscript as Heiðreks gátur , two texts that share many features. 32 It is clear that in this paper manuscript the contents are based in part on generic similarity, in part on the taste of the compiler, and most probably on the range of sources available to the scribe who composed the manuscript. The manuscript concludes with versions of Sigurdrífumál and Hárbarðsljóð , a notable juxtaposition of heroic and mythic content. 33

The variability of content in the paper manuscripts likely results from the variability of source materials scribes had to work with when they composed the manuscripts, and also likely reflects particular tastes of each compiler. The above examples (AM 738 4to, AM 747 4to, AM 164 8vo) are all notable for the fact that Vafþrúðnismál appears in each in a different context. In the parchment manuscript tradition, the two surviving manuscripts of eddic poetry present the poem alongside Grímnismál , or in other cases stanzas are

The leaves of AM 164 8vo are 162mm x 97–102mm.

found within the context of Snorra Edda . The three paper manuscript exam - ples described so far are more varied. Only one manuscript (AM 738 4to) has both Vafþrúðnismál and Grímnismal , for instance, though they are as before presented side by side. There are many more paper manuscripts that contain Vafþrúðnismál among mixed contents. GKS 2366 4to, from the seventeenth century, is somewhat unique among this motley group, as the poem appears in fragmentary form up to and including stanza 45, and these forty-five stanzas comprise the whole of the contents of this manuscript. 34 NKS 1883 4to is a paper manuscript that is one-hundred and nine leaves in length; it is divided into two parts, and was composed in the eighteenth century. In the first part are sections of Snorra Edda , and in the second part of the manuscript Rígsþula appears as a complete text, followed by a fragment of Vafþrúðnismál , both of which were copied from AM 747 4to (see above). Finally, NKS 1873 4to, which is sixty-nine leaves in length and was composed in the second half of the eighteenth century, 35 and Thott 1499 4to, 36 which is ninety-one leaves in length and was composed in the eighteenth century, are both manuscripts with diverse contents in which Vafþrúðnismál appears alongside Heiðreks gátur , reinforcing this familiar connection. During the early modern transmission of this text scribes used both precedent and their own logic to group texts together, striking a balance between stability and change, fidelity and freedom, tradition and transformation. Annette Lassen has published important work on the manuscript transmis - sion of the younger eddic poem Hrafnagaldur Óðins , work that proves valuable to study of the transmission of other eddic poems in the early modern period, in particular her descriptions of and commentary on two specific groupings of paper manuscripts. 37 In the first group, there is a continuation of the original order of the poems in R but also an awareness of a readership on the European continent, demonstrated most notably by the inclusion of Latin translations of some of the poems; the second group has examples of manuscripts that order the poems consistently with R, but with some variation. Besides these two group - ings of manuscripts, which are paper copies of parchment manuscripts and perhaps earlier paper manuscripts, the practice of composing paper manuscripts based on the contents of printed books emerged.

VAFÞRÚÐNISMÁL , FROM PARCHMENT TO PRINT

of printed editions of eddic poetry on the European continent, there was less need for paper manuscripts, but the practice was not discontinued completely, especially in Iceland, where eddic poetry was not printed until much later. 38

The youngest paper manuscripts therefore straddle both the manuscript and print traditions, one foot firmly planted in each. The paper manuscript tradition shows us how the transmission of Vafþrúðnismál was for the most part a stable process, but not completely so. As the poem travelled through the centuries it became juxtaposed and integrated with increasingly diverse material, including illustrations in one case discussed above, though it often found its familiar place amongst other eddic mythological poems. In many of the examples from the paper manuscript tradition, the poem appears after the final part of Hávamál and before Grímnismál , but examples where this is not the case are also plentiful, some of which are discussed above. The paper manuscript tradition also reinforces the idea that through the centu - ries mythological and heroic eddic poems have been considered independent groupings. When preserved together, they are commonly juxtaposed with one another as groupings, and there is no indication that mythological eddic poems were ever found intermingled with the heroic eddic poems. 39 These groups are complementary to one another but were kept segregated. Even though there are many examples of parchment and paper manu - scripts that have survived, there are also many lost manuscripts. The great Copenhagen fire of 1728 is known to have destroyed many manuscripts, both paper and parchment, and a considerable number of printed books. Writing

38 See Lassen, who writes that ‘in Iceland in the nineteenth century, we see a new kind of scribal activity or a different attitude to compilation, in that there come to be examples of anthologies of a more varied content than had appeared before. We also find copies of the Arnamagnæan edition, and also of Rask’s and Scheving’s editions, and the latest manuscript is a copy of Bugge’s edition with an English translation’; ‘Introduction’, pp. 80–1. 39 An exception to this trend is the heroic eddic poem Sigrdrífumál , which in several paper manuscripts appears intermingled with mythological poems: in AM 161 8vo, a seventeenth-century paper manuscript, Sigrdrífumál is set between Hávamál and Snorra Edda ; in LBS 631 4to, a late eighteenth- or early nineteenth-century manuscript of mixed contents, a fragment of Sigrdrífumál is set after Alvíssmál and before Völuspá ; and, in ÍB 68 4to, an eighteenth-century paper manuscript, Sigrdrífumál is set between Hávamál and a text about runes copied from a work composed by Ole Worm; for these respective examples, see Handrit.is as follows: https://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/is/AM08-0161; https://handrit.is/en/man - uscript/view/is/Lbs04-0631; https://handrit.is/en/manuscript/view/is/IB04-0068 [accessed 20 May 2021]. While this exception may cast doubt on the apparent independence of the mythological and heroic groupings of eddic poems in the paper manuscript tradition, it appears to be an anomaly, though one that calls for further research.

about Árni Magnússon’s collections of eddic poetry, Lassen points out that ‘no fewer than fifteen collections he owned were destroyed in the fire in 1728’. 40

It can be overwhelming to try to comprehend the great amount of material that survives from the past, but perhaps it is even more overwhelming to imagine the mass of material that has perished. As the poem travelled through the paper manuscript tradition, its context remained stable in important ways, but continued to diversify. As we will see in the next section of this chapter, since its appearance in print, the context for Vafþrúðnismál has become even more stable and what change remains has more to do with translation and artistic interpretation than textual proximity and ordering within the manuscript tradition. The seventeenth-, eighteenth-, and nineteenth-century philologists who created the earliest print editions of eddic poetry played an essential role in preparing these texts for popular reception and critical interpretation.

Printed Editions

The print tradition for eddic poetry begins not in Iceland, but on the European continent, with the earliest editions coming from Copenhagen. In Iceland, printing focused largely on religious texts in the seventeenth, eighteenth, and even nineteenth centuries. In 1665 P.H. Resen (1625–88) published the first editions of Snorra Edda along with the first two poems in R, Völuspá and Hávamál . In his introduc - tion to the facsimile edition, Anthony Faulkes writes, ‘P.H. Resen’s first edition of Vǫluspá and his edition of Hávamál were printed together with his Edda Islandorum (i.e., the Prose Edda) and were published in the same year, and in many copies all three works were bound together, though their order varies’. 41 This precedent set the standard for centuries of scholarship that followed, which favoured Völuspá and Hávamál over the poems that follow them in the Codex Regius. The first appearance of any fragment of Vafþrúðnismál in print is from the great study of 1689 by Thomas Bartholin (1616–80), titled Antiquitatum danicarum de causis contemptae a Danis adhuc gentilibus mortis , in which stanza 41 appears in the context of a larger block quote from Snorra Edda . 42 In the study, Bartholin gives much atten -

tion to other eddic poems such as Völuspá , Hávamál , and Grímnismál , but less to Vafþrúðnismál , which is surprising due to its close relation with those poems and with Grímnismál in particular. Rather than indicating a lack of interest, however, this most likely points to the great wealth of information that was becoming available during the latter half of the seventeenth century in Copenhagen, as Old Norse manuscripts were being collected and brought over from Iceland. Grímur Jónsson Thorkelín (1752–1829) published an edition of Vafþrúðnismál with a Latin translation in 1779, once again in Copenhagen. 43 The inclusion of a Latin translation alongside the Icelandic text implies that the editor and translator was reaching out to an international audience for the poem. 44 This edition is little known and uninfluential in comparison to the editions that come after it, however it is important as a landmark first edition of the poem. The text begins with a Latin introduction and then the poem appears in Icelandic with each facing page in Latin translation, and Latin footnotes accompany both the Icelandic and Latin texts. After these texts, there is an extensive index of proper Icelandic nouns that appear in the poem which functions as a glossary. A review of Grímur Thorkelín’s work appeared in the Nye kritik journal (1779, 185–88), where the edition is described, and the poem essentially summarized. With this edition, translation, and critical reception, it can be said that the modern critical environment for Vafþrúðnismál was emerging. Shortly after Grímur Thorkelín’s edition, a Danish translation of eddic poems by Bertel Christian Sandvig (1752–86) was published, titled Forsøg til en Oversættelse af Sæmunds Edda (1783–85), appearing in two volumes. 45

Vafþrúðnismál is found in the first volume, after Sólarljóð , Hrafnagaldur Óðins , Völuspá , and Hávamál , and, as is most common, Grímnismál follows the text of Vafþrúðnismál . 46 Interestingly, as the print editions appear, the context in which the poem is found conforms more to the parchment tradition than it

does the paper tradition. The paper manuscript tradition did, however, leave an impact on early print editions and translations as far as juxtaposed content is concerned, for while paper manuscripts generally transmitted Vafþrúðnismál in line with the parchment tradition, they also included later poems under eddic metre (e.g., Rígsþula , Sólarljóð , and Hrafnagaldur Óðins ) alongside the R and A poems, and these poems are variably found in early print editions. Vafþrúðnismál appears in the first full edition of eddic poetry, published by Den Arnamagnæanske Kommission and released in three volumes in 1787, 1818, and 1828. 47 Volume 1 (1787) includes Vafþrúðnismál and the other myth - ological poems that had not been published in Resen’s editions of Snorra Edda , Völuspá , and Hávamál in 1665. With the arrival of the first volume most of the mythological eddic poems were then available in print and for a wider audience than had previously had access to the material. The volume begins with a general introduction in Latin, followed by a biography of Sæmundr fróði by Árni Magnússon. Vafþrúðnismál is then presented as the first poem in the volume and there is a short introduction to the poem, also in Latin, before the Icelandic and Latin texts of the poem are given, stanza by stanza. Notes are provided in Latin throughout the text of the poem. After Vafþrúðnismál is Grímnismál , in its familiar place, followed by Skírnismál and other mytholog - ical poems from R, and then the late Hrafnagaldur Óðins , Vegtamskviða (i.e., Baldrs draumar ), Alvíssmál , Fjölsvinnsmál , Hyndluljóð , and as an appendix Sólarljóð . The volume concludes with an extensive glossary and an index of Latin proper nouns. These early editions show us that a first major recontex - tualization of eddic poetry in the print tradition was the process of providing paratext in Latin and other languages. 48

VAFÞRÚÐNISMÁL , FROM PARCHMENT TO PRINT

Many more editions of eddic poetry have appeared over the course of the past two centuries, all containing Vafþrúðnismál , and all presenting the poems consistent with early print editions. The present chapter describes only a few to illustrate editorial trends. 49 Notable editions include those by Sophus Bugge (1867), Gustav Neckel (1914, 1926, 1936, 1962, 1983) revised by Hans Kuhn for editions 4–5, Finnur Jónsson (1932) and Gísli Sigurðsson (1998). By far the most commonly cited and studied edition up to the present has been the edition by Gustav Neckel, revised by Hans Kuhn, and commonly referred to as Neckel-Kuhn, though the popularity of this edition among scholars has recently been challenged (see below). More recently, Tim Machan prepared an edition of Vafþrúðnismál which includes an extensive critical interpretation of the poem in his notes and commentary. Machan’s edition is the only in-depth study, other than Grímur Thorkelín’s (1779) lesser-known study (see above), dedicated solely to the poem. The text of his edition relies primarily on R, but at points collates text from A and from the fragments of Vafþrúðnismál from Snorra Edda manuscripts. By aiming to preserve the integrity of the R text, Machan has accordingly preserved that manuscript’s orthography, with the result that his text echoes the diversity of medieval manuscript orthography. 50 Jónas Kristjánsson (1924–2014) and Vésteinn Ólason have prepared the most current scholarly edition of eddic poetry as a part of the Íslenzk fornrit series of medi - eval Icelandic texts. 51 The editors of the Íslenzk fornrit edition intend for it to be the primary edition of eddic poetry for international scholarship, chal - lenging the ubiquity of Neckel-Kuhn (1962 and 1983). The editorial principles of the edition follow the Íslenzk fornrit series precedent, 52 resulting in a text that is grounded in the thirteenth century though with a normalized script that is more accessible for modern readers. Thus, by laying out a readable text and presenting issues of orthography in the notes, the Íslenzk fornrit editors have taken a more moderate course in comparison to Machan’s edition, which rep -

The most recent facsimile edition includes diplomatic and nor - malized versions of the complete text of R, and would find a welcome home among the bookshelves of any eddic scholar: Vésteinn Ólason and Guðvarður Már Gunnlaugsson (eds), Konungsbók eddukvæða = Codex Regius: Stofnun Árna Magnússonar á Íslandi Gl.Kgl.Sml 2365 4to (Reykjavík, 2001). 49 For more on editions up to 1914, see Halldór Hermannsson, Bibliography of the Eddas , pp. 1–9.

licates the orthography in R as accurately as possible. These two versions of the text are therefore complementary, and together they provide an important modern lens through which to view the legacy of Vafþrúðnismál . Notably, in 2019 The Arnamagnæan Institute in Copenhagen and The Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjavík jointly published The Codex Regius of the Poetic Edda: Konungsbók eddukvæða GKS 2365 4to , a print edition presenting the full diplomatic text of R. The print edition is complemented by a ground-breaking, open access digital edition of the manuscript’s text. 53 With the digital edition, the texts of all eddic poems from R, including Vafþrúðnismál , are available online in facsimile, diplo - matic, and normalized versions. The digital edition, published in the Editiones Arnamagnæanæ Electronicæ series, promises to be at the forefront of all future research into the poems of R, alongside the Íslenzk fornrit edition. Like all eddic poetry, Vafþrúðnismál has a nebulous prehistory in oral culture before finding its place in the parchment manuscript tradition of medi - eval Iceland in the thirteenth century. Luckily the R manuscript has survived up to the present day, along with most of the A manuscript, so we are able to consult these early witnesses. As we have seen, even in the medieval period, parts of the poem were found in the context of Snorra Edda , a text with which it shares many structural and thematic features, and then in the age of paper manuscripts the poem found life in several new contexts. The narrative of the poem has become entwined in the textual culture of the ages it has passed through, and the textual cultures of the periods acted upon the text. Beginning in the late-eighteenth century, translations into Latin and other languages became increasingly available, and now in the twenty-first century, many versions can be found in dozens of languages.

Conclusion

The textual history of the poem, and any medieval text, is important to take into account, especially when we are reading a work from many centuries past, for the journey that the text has taken to the present age provides the

VAFÞRÚÐNISMÁL , FROM PARCHMENT TO PRINT

foundation upon which a modern interpretation of the poem is made. At each stage of transmission, the critical field has itself been shaped, and the contours of the critical field then travel alongside the text. As the world has changed, the materials and technologies of transmission have changed, as well as inter - pretative practices. Thus, when we read a modern version of Vafþrúðnismál , we are also reading all of what is behind the text, including the many pages of parchment and paper that have been lost, but particularly we are reading a modern representation of what has survived. We thus read a representation of a representation, for the earliest witnesses themselves represent an oral tradition we can only grasp at, but never touch. Even though the legacy of Vafþrúðnir is overshadowed by that of his attacker Óðinn, the poem named after him survives and has not been lost over time, though the context in which it appears has transformed a great deal. With the variations in context, the meaning of the poem has also been subject to change. What I would like to emphasize as I conclude this chapter is the significant role that the philological tradition has played in presenting this material to scholarly and popular audiences in the modern era. In the case of Vafþrúðnismál and other eddic poetry, it was the Nordic philological tradition in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries that was foundational, for the work of these scholars in Iceland, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden brought these stories to a much wider readership and played a huge role in outlining the contours of what medieval scholars and medieval enthusiasts alike are able to work with in their interpretations of the past. Work by scholars in these countries and others continues to open up the past for us now in the present. In the poems Vafþrúðnismál is most often found juxtaposed with – Völuspá , Hávamál , and especially Grímnismál – Óðinn does not contend in knowledge with any other being. In Völuspá he receives knowledge from a seeress, in Hávamál he delivers his knowledge to an audience and recounts how he has become so wise, and in Grímnismál he lectures his captors on the geography and inhabitants of the cosmos. Vafþrúðnir has the sole role in the mythological context here explored of testing Óðinn’s mental abilities, but the god’s wit is so sharp, and his cunning so keen, that the giant’s life is ended. This concludes a history of the transformation of the Lay of Vafþrúðnir from parchment to print, but it is also just another stop along the way. In the coming years there will be a necessary consideration of the poem’s now-active digital transmission, which will warrant a review of the text and its current travels through the digital age.
