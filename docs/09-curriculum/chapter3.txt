Chapter 3 Vectors
Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe which stands
continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless
one first learns to comprehend the language and read the letters in which
it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its
characters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures without
which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without
these, one wanders about in a dark labyrinth.1

3.1 Vector Analysis
3.1.1 Introduction to Vectors
Certain physical quantities such as mass or the absolute temperature at some point in
space only have magnitude. A single number can represent each of these quantities, with
appropriate units, which are called scalar quantities. There are, however, other physical
quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Force is an example of a quantity that
has both direction and magnitude (strength). Three numbers are needed to represent the
magnitude and direction of a vector quantity in a three dimensional space. These
quantities are called vector quantities. Vector quantities also satisfy two distinct
operations, vector addition and multiplication of a vector by a scalar. We can add two
forces together and the sum of the forces must satisfy the rule for vector addition. We can
multiply a force by a scalar thus increasing or decreasing its strength. Position,
displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, and momentum are all physical quantities that
can be represented mathematically by vectors. The set of vectors and the two operations
form what is called a vector space. There are many types of vector spaces but we shall
restrict our attention to the very familiar type of vector space in three dimensions that
most students have encountered in their mathematical courses. We shall begin our
discussion by defining what we mean by a vector in three dimensional space, and the
rules for the operations of vector addition and multiplication of a vector by a scalar.
3.1.2 Properties of Vectors
A vector is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. Let a vector be denoted by



the symbol A . The magnitude of A is | A |≡ A . We can represent vectors as geometric
objects using arrows. The length of the arrow corresponds to the magnitude of the vector.
The arrow points in the direction of the vector (Figure 3.1).

law of vector addition. The vectors A and B can be drawn with their tails at the same
point. The two vectors form the sides of a parallelogram. The diagonal of the

parallelogram corresponds to the vector C = A + B , as shown in Figure 3.2b.

Vector addition satisfies the following four properties:
(i) Commutativity:
The order of adding vectors does not matter;

   
A+B =B+A.

(3.1.1)

Our geometric definition for vector addition satisfies the commutative property (3.1.1).
We can understand this geometrically because in the head to tail representation for the

addition of vectors, it doesn’t matter which vector you begin with, the sum is the same
vector, as seen in Figure 3.3.

(2) Scalar Multiplication of Vectors:


Vectors can be multiplied by real numbers. Let A be a vector. Let c be a real positive

number. Then the multiplication of A by c is a new vector, which we denote by the



symbol c A . The magnitude of c A is c times the magnitude of A (Figure 3.6a),



cA = c A .

Let c > 0 , then the direction of c A is the same as the direction of A . However, the

direction of −c A is opposite of A (Figure 3.6).

3.2 Coordinate Systems
Physics involve the study of phenomena that we observe in the world. In order to connect
the phenomena to mathematics we begin by introducing the concept of a coordinate
system. A coordinate system consists of four basic elements:
(1) Choice of origin
(2) Choice of axes
(3) Choice of positive direction for each axis
(4) Choice of unit vectors at every point in space
There are three commonly used coordinate systems: Cartesian, cylindrical and spherical.
In this chapter we will describe a Cartesian coordinate system and a cylindrical
coordinate system.
3.2.1 Cartesian Coordinate System
Cartesian coordinates consist of a set of mutually perpendicular axes, which intersect at a
common point, the origin O . We live in a three-dimensional spatial world; for that
reason, the most common system we will use has three axes.
(1) Choice of Origin: Choose an origin O at any point that is most convenient.
(2) Choice of Axes: The simplest set of axes is known as the Cartesian axes, x -axis, y axis, and the z -axis, that are at right angles with respect to each other. Then each point
P in space can be assigned a triplet of values (x P , y P , z P ) , the Cartesian coordinates of
the point P . The ranges of these values are: −∞ < xP < +∞ ,
−∞ < yP < +∞ , −∞ < z P < +∞ .
(3) Choice of Positive Direction: Our third choice is an assignment of positive direction
for each coordinate axis. We shall denote this choice by the symbol + along the positive
axis. In physics problems we are free to choose our axes and positive directions any way
that we decide best fits a given problem. Problems that are very difficult using the

7

conventional choices may turn out to be much easier to solve by making a thoughtful
choice of axes.
(4) Choice of Unit Vectors: We now associate to each point P in space, a set of three
unit vectors (î P , ĵP ,k̂ P ) . A unit vector has magnitude one: ˆi P = 1 , ˆjP = 1 , and kˆ P = 1 .
We assign the direction of î P to point in the direction of the increasing x -coordinate at
the point P . We define the directions for ĵP and k̂ P in the direction of the increasing
y -coordinate and z -coordinate respectively, (Figure 3.10). If we choose a different point
S , and define a similar set of unit vectors (îS , ĵS , k̂ S ) , the unit vectors at S and P
satisfy the equalities
(3.2.1)
îS = î P , ĵS = ĵP , and k̂ S = k̂ P ,

because vectors are equal if they have the same direction and magnitude regardless of
where they are located in space.

Figure 3.10 Choice of unit vectors at points P and S .
A Cartesian coordinate system is the only coordinate system in which Eq. (3.2.1) holds
for all pair of points. We therefore drop the reference to the point P and use (î, ĵ, k̂) to
represent the unit vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system (Figure 3.11).

3.2.2 Cylindrical Coordinate System
Many physical objects demonstrate some type of symmetry. For example if you rotate a
uniform cylinder about the longitudinal axis (symmetry axis), the cylinder appears
unchanged. The operation of rotating the cylinder is called a symmetry operation, and the
object undergoing the operation, the cylinder, is exactly the same as before the operation
was performed. This symmetry property of cylinders suggests a coordinate system, called
a cylindrical coordinate system, that makes the symmetrical property under rotations
transparent.
First choose an origin O and axis through O , which we call the z -axis. The
cylindrical coordinates for a point P are the three numbers (r,θ , z) (Figure 3.12). The
number z represents the familiar coordinate of the point P along the z -axis. The
nonnegative number r represents the distance from the z -axis to the point P . The points
in space corresponding to a constant positive value of r lie on a circular cylinder. The
locus of points corresponding to r = 0 is the z -axis. In the plane z = 0 , define a
reference ray through O , which we shall refer to as the positive x -axis. Draw a line
through the point P that is parallel to the z -axis. Let D denote the point of intersection
between that line PD and the plane z = 0 . Draw a ray OD from the origin to the point
D . Let θ denote the directed angle from the reference ray to the ray OD . The angle θ is
positive when measured counterclockwise and negative when measured clockwise.

Figure 3.12 Cylindrical Coordinates
The coordinates (r,θ ) are called polar coordinates. The coordinate transformations
between (r,θ ) and the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) are given by

9

x = r cosθ ,
y = r sin θ .

(3.2.2)
(3.2.3)

Conversely, if we are given the Cartesian coordinates (x, y) , the coordinates (r,θ ) can
be determined from the coordinate transformations
r = +(x 2 + y 2 )1 2 ,

(3.2.4)

θ = tan −1 ( y / x) .

(3.2.5)

We choose a set of unit vectors (r̂P ,θ̂ P ,k̂ P ) at the point P as follows. We choose k̂ P to
point in the direction of increasing z . We choose r̂P to point in the direction of
increasing r , directed radially away from the z -axis. We choose θˆ to point in the
P

direction of increasing θ . This unit vector points in the counterclockwise direction,
tangent to the circle (Figure 3.13a). One crucial difference between cylindrical
coordinates and Cartesian coordinates involves the choice of unit vectors. Suppose we
consider a different point S in the plane. The unit vectors (r̂S ,θˆ S ,kˆ S ) at the point S are
also shown in Figure 3.13. Note that r̂P ≠ r̂S and θ̂ P ≠ θ̂ S because their direction differ.
We shall drop the subscripts denoting the points at which the unit vectors are defined at
and simply refer to the set of unit vectors at a point as (r̂,θ̂,k̂ ) , with the understanding
ˆ depend on the location of the point in question.
