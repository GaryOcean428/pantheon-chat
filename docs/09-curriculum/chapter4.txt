Chapter 4 One Dimensional Kinematics
In the first place, what do we mean by time and space? It turns out that these deep
philosophical questions have to be analyzed very carefully in physics, and this is
not easy to do. The theory of relativity shows that our ideas of space and time are
not as simple as one might imagine at first sight. However, for our present
purposes, for the accuracy that we need at first, we need not be very careful about
defining things precisely. Perhaps you say, “That’s a terrible thing—I learned
that in science we have to define everything precisely.” We cannot define
anything precisely! If we attempt to, we get into that paralysis of thought that
comes to philosophers, who sit opposite each other, one saying to the other, “You
don’t know what you are talking about!” The second one says. “What do you
mean by know? What do you mean by talking? What do you mean by you?”, and
so on. In order to be able to talk constructively, we just have to agree that we are
talking roughly about the same thing. You know as much about time as you need
for the present, but remember that there are some subtleties that have to be
discussed; we shall discuss them later.1

4.1 Introduction
Kinematics is the mathematical description of motion. The term is derived from the
Greek word kinema, meaning movement. In order to quantify motion, a mathematical
coordinate system, called a reference frame, is used to describe space and time. Once a
reference frame has been chosen, we shall introduce the physical concepts of position,
velocity and acceleration in a mathematically precise manner. Figure 4.1 shows a
Cartesian coordinate system in one dimension with unit vector î pointing in the direction
of increasing x -coordinate.

4.2 Position, Time Interval, Displacement
4.2.1 Position
Consider a point-like object moving in one dimension. We denote the position
coordinate of the object with respect to the choice of origin by x(t) . The position
coordinate is a function of time and can be positive, zero, or negative, depending on the
location of the object. The position of the object with respect to the origin has both
direction and magnitude, and hence is a vector (Figure 4.2), which we shall denote as the
position vector (or simply position) and write as

r(t) = x(t) î .

(4.2.1)

We denote the position coordinate at t = 0 by the symbol x0 ≡ x(t = 0) . The SI unit for
position is the meter [m].

4.2.2 Time Interval
Consider a closed interval of time [t1 , t2 ] . We characterize this time interval by the
difference in endpoints of the interval,
(4.2.2)
Δt = t2 − t1 .
The SI units for time intervals are seconds [s].
4.2.3 Displacement
The displacement of a body during a time interval [t1 , t2 ] (Figure 4.3) is defined
to be the change in the position of the body
 

Δr ≡ r(t2 ) − r(t1 ) = (x(t2 ) − x(t1 )) î ≡ Δx(t) î .

4.3 Velocity
When describing the motion of objects, words like “speed” and “velocity” are used in
natural language; however when introducing a mathematical description of motion, we
need to define these terms precisely. Our procedure will be to define average quantities
for finite intervals of time and then examine what happens in the limit as the time interval
becomes infinitesimally small. This will lead us to the mathematical concept that velocity
at an instant in time is the derivative of the position with respect to time.
4.3.1 Average Velocity
The x -component of the average velocity, vx,ave , for a time interval Δt is defined
to be the displacement Δx divided by the time interval Δt ,

vx,ave ≡

Δx
.
Δt

(4.3.1)

Because we are describing one-dimensional motion we shall drop the subscript x and
denote
vave = vx,ave .
(4.3.2)
When we introduce two-dimensional motion we will distinguish the components of the
velocity by subscripts. The average velocity vector is then

Δx

v ave ≡
î = vave î .
Δt

(4.3.3)

The SI units for average velocity are meters per second ⎡⎣ m⋅s −1 ⎤⎦ . The average velocity is

not necessarily equal to the distance in the time interval Δt traveled divided by the time
interval Δt . For example, during a time interval, an object moves in the positive x direction and then returns to its starting position, the displacement of the object is zero,
but the distance traveled is non-zero.

4.3.3 Instantaneous Velocity
Consider a body moving in one direction. During the time interval [t, t + Δt] , the average
velocity corresponds to the slope of the line connecting the points (t, x(t )) and
(t + Δt, x(t + Δt)) . The slope, the rise over the run, is the change in position divided by
the change in time, and is given by

vave ≡

rise Δx x(t + Δt) − x(t)
=
=
.

Δt

(4.3.4)

As Δt → 0 , the slope of the lines connecting the points (t, x(t)) and (t + Δt, x(t + Δt)) ,
approach slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function x(t) at the time t (Figure
4.4).

The limiting value of this sequence is defined to be the x -component of the
instantaneous velocity at the time t .
The x -component of instantaneous velocity at time t is given by the
slope of the tangent line to the graph of the position function at time t :

(4.3.5)

The instantaneous velocity vector is then

v(t) = v(t) î .

(4.3.6)

The component of the velocity, v(t) , can be positive, zero, or negative, depending on
whether the object is travelling in the positive x -direction, instantaneously at rest, or the
negative x -direction.

Example 4.1 Determining Velocity from Position
Consider an object that is moving along the x -coordinate axis with the position function
given by
1
x(t) = x0 + bt 2
(4.3.7)
2
where x0 is the initial position of the object at t = 0 . We can explicitly calculate the x component of instantaneous velocity from Equation (4.3.5) by first calculating the
displacement in the x -direction, Δx = x(t + Δt) − x(t ) . We need to calculate the position
at time t + Δt ,
1
1
x(t + Δt) = x0 + b(t + Δt)2 = x0 + b(t 2 + 2tΔt + Δt 2 ) .
(4.3.8)
2
2
Then the x -component of instantaneous velocity is
⎛
⎞ ⎛

This expression reduces to
⎛

(4.3.10)

The first term is independent of the interval Δt and the second term vanishes because in
the limit as Δt → 0 , the term (1/ 2)bΔt → 0 is zero. Therefore the x -component of
instantaneous velocity at time t is
(4.3.11)
v(t) = bt .
In Figure 4.5 we plot the instantaneous velocity, v(t) , as a function of time t .

Example 4.2 Mean Value Theorem
Consider an object that is moving along the x -coordinate axis with the position function
given by
1
x(t) = x0 + v0t + bt 2 .

(4.3.13)

For the time interval [ti ,t f ] , the displacement of the object is

1
1
x(t f ) − x(ti ) = Δx = v0 (t f − ti ) + b(t f 2 − ti 2 ) = v0 (t f − ti ) + b(t f − ti )(t f + ti ) . (4.3.14)
2
2
Recall that the x -component of the average velocity is defined by the condition that

Δx = vave (t f − ti ) .

(4.3.15)

We can determine the average velocity by substituting Eq. (4.3.15) into Eq. (4.3.14)
yielding

7

1
vave = v0 + b(t f + ti ) .
2

(4.3.16)

The Mean Value Theorem from calculus states that there exists an instant in time t1 , with

ti < t1 < t f , such that the x -component of the instantaneously velocity, v(t1 ) , satisfies
Δx = v(t1 )(t f − ti ) .

(4.3.17)

Geometrically this means that the slope of the straight line (blue line in Figure 4.6)
connecting the points (ti , x(ti )) to (t f , x(t f )) is equal to the slope of the tangent line (red
line in Figure 4.6) to the graph of x(t) vs. t at the point (t1 , x(t1 )) (Figure 4.6),
v(t1 ) = vave .

(4.3.18)

v(t1 ) = v0 + bt1 .

(4.3.19)

We know from Eq. (4.3.13) that

We can solve for the time t1 by substituting Eqs. (4.3.19) and (4.3.16) into Eq. (4.3.18)
yielding
t1 = (t f + ti ) / 2
(4.3.20)
This intermediate value v(t1 ) is also equal to one-half the sum of the initial velocity and
final velocity

v(t1 ) =

v(ti ) + v(t f )
2

=

(v0 + bti ) + (v0 + bt f )
2

1
= v0 + b(t f + ti ) = v0 + bt1 . (4.3.21)
2

For any time interval, the quantity (v(ti ) + v(t f )) / 2 , is the arithmetic mean of the initial
velocity and the final velocity (but unfortunately is also sometimes referred to as the
average velocity). The average velocity, which we defined as vave = (x f − xi ) / Δt , and the
arithmetic mean, (v(ti ) + v(t f )) / 2 , are only equal in the special case when the velocity is
a linear function in the variable t as in this example, (Eq. (4.3.13)). We shall only use the
term average velocity to mean displacement divided by the time interval.

8

4.4 Acceleration
We shall apply the same physical and mathematical procedure for defining acceleration,
as the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. We first consider how the
instantaneous velocity changes over a fixed time interval of time and then take the limit
as the time interval approaches zero.
4.4.1 Average Acceleration
Average acceleration is the quantity that measures a change in velocity over a particular
time interval. Suppose during a time interval Δt a body undergoes a change in velocity

 

Δv = v(t + Δt) − v(t ) .

(4.3.22)

The change in the x -component of the velocity, Δv , for the time interval [t, t + Δt] is
then
(4.3.23)
Δv = v(t + Δt) − v(t) .
The x -component of the average acceleration for the time interval Δt is defined
to be
Δv
(v(t + Δt) − v(t))

a ave = aave î ≡
î =
î .

The SI units for average acceleration are meters per second squared, [m⋅s −2 ] .

Figure 4.7 Graph of velocity vs. time showing the tangent line at time t .
The average acceleration for a fixed time interval Δt is the slope of the straight line
connecting the two points (t, v(t)) and (t + Δt, v(t + Δt)) . In order to define the x component of the instantaneous acceleration at time t , we employ the same limiting
argument as we did when we defined the instantaneous velocity in terms of the slope of
the tangent line.
The x -component of the instantaneous acceleration at time t is the slope of the
tangent line at time t of the graph of the x -component of the velocity as a
function of time,

The instantaneous acceleration vector at time t is then

Because the velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time, the x -component
of the acceleration is the second derivative of the position function,
