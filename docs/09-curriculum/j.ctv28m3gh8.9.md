## Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in Medieval Iceland:


## Saga Realism and the Sworn Brothers
Ármann Jakobsson

The history of the reception of the Sagas of Icelanders is lengthy and complex, ever since their emergence as written texts in the thirteenth century. Whereas most of the sagas are earliest attested in fourteenth-century manuscripts and a handful only in fifteenth-century or post-medieval manuscripts, Sigurður Nordal (1886–1974) grouped the sagas into five evolutionary stages, dating the earliest sagas to about 1200 and the youngest to the latter half of the fourteenth century. In this system, most of the best-known or ‘classical sagas’ were composed in the thirteenth century. Sigurður Nordal proposed a development from clumsy and ‘historical’ sagas to the true works of art, followed by a degeneration into completely fictional sagas that were exaggerated and colourless. 1 However, no accounts exist that shed much light on the original audience reactions to these narratives and very little can be discerned from the texts themselves about the probable initial audience reception of the sagas. 2 It is, however, still necessary for the critic to keep the saga audience constantly in mind – like all texts, the sagas are intended to communicate something to someone for some reason.

1 See, e.g., Sigurður Nordal, Um íslenzkar fornsögur (Reykjavík, 1968), pp. 103–11. On the oldest manuscript attestation of individual sagas, see e.g., Örnólfur Thorsson, ‘Leitin að landinu fagra: Hugleiðing um rannsóknir á íslenskum forn - bókmenntum’, Skáldskaparmál , 1 (1990), 28–53. 2 For a long while literary criticism has been aware of the ‘implied author’ and ‘implied audience’ present in every text; see Wayne C. Booth, The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago, 1961), and Seymour Chatman, Story and Discourse: Narrative Structure in Fiction and Film (Ithaca, NY, 1978). The implied author and audience are within the text. They are closely linked to the actual biological author and the more diverse actual biological audience, but are still a part of language rather than biology, and are vital to textual interpretation. The implied audience is always present in the will to convince and communicate, without it there would be no need for narrative.

DR JEKYLL AND MR HYDE IN MEDIEVAL ICELAND

This study takes as its starting point the late nineteenth- and early twen - tieth-century scholarly and popular reactions to the medieval Icelandic Fóstbræðra saga and juxtaposes them with a different interpretation that may shed light on the meaning of the text both to a modern and a medieval audience, although this meaning may be far from overt in the minds of either group. Any discussion of meaning must necessarily be concerned with the potential of a text to mean, as the actual meaning of a text to an actual reader or listener is not easy to locate. The meaning of any text is the product of an uneasy contract between its author and audience and thus it is important to work from the premise that a new audience must in some way create a new meaning of the text. Such potential interpretations are the focus of the present study. Fóstbrœðra saga is the narrative of two sworn brothers with seemingly opposite personalities; 3 Þorgeirr Hávarsson is a brave and merciless warrior who kills people for entertainment, whereas Þormóðr Kolbrúnarskáld is a mischievous womaniser and poet. In spite of this difference, the main theme of the saga is their undying loyalty to each other, which goes beyond the grave as Þormóðr spends most of his days after Þorgeirr’s death avenging his unlovable partner. In this study, it is argued that a realistic interpretation of this scenario is seriously undermined by the lack of empathy any audience could possibly feel with the cruel Þorgeirr. However, if a more psychological interpretation, inspired by the study of folktales, is attempted, the significance of the strange plot is transformed into something more meaningful.

The Sagas as Realistic Masterpieces

For a good part of the twentieth century, scholars tended to interpret the sagas as shining examples of medieval realism, and thus closely akin to prominent novels of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, texts these same scholars were accustomed to reacting to and enjoying. In 1962, Einar Ólafur Sveinsson (1899–1984), at the time professor of literature at the University of Iceland, wrote that the sagas’ attitude to reality could be characterised as ‘heroic realism’. 4 That same year Einar Ólafur was appointed the head

3 Like many Old Norse terms, fóstbróðir is vague in the sagas, but in some cases, it seems to refer to a specific ritual that leaves the members of the brotherhood under an obligation to avenge each other. This is the case with Þormóðr and Þorgeirr in Fóstbrœðra saga , as in their youth they swear an oath of fealty to each other; see Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , Íslenzk fornrit 6 (Reykjavík, 1943), pp. 124–5. 4 ‘Í.s. forhold til virkeligheden kan måske karakteriseres som heroisk realisme’: Einar Ólafur Sveinsson, ‘Íslendingasögur’, in Kulturhistorisk Leksikon for Nordisk

of a new Manuscript Institute of Iceland ( Handritastofnun Íslands ), in 1972 renamed the Árni Magnússon Institute. His status as an authority on the sagas was thus further institutionalised, but of course it also owed a lot to his immense learning and deep knowledge of the sagas. Shortly after, the notion of medieval Icelandic heroism was challenged, in particular by Theodore M. Andersson who questioned the idea of thinking of the sagas in the same terms as the heroic eddic poetry, 5 but there is still a need to talk about realism and the sagas, 6 possibly even more so in an age where realism is no longer the primary literary genre, and fantasy and science fiction are more and more prominent both among regular readers and in the literary debate. Realism can, of course, be defined in a variety of ways. As a scholarly term for medieval literature, realism has often remained conveniently undefined, but any ideas of literary realism in twentieth-century Iceland would be bound to be at least partly influenced by the late nineteenth-century literature move - ment championed, for example, by French critics Champfleury and Hippolyte Taine, which went on to evolve into naturalism. 7 In the late nineteenth century, the realism literary movement was strong in Iceland, influenced not least by the noted Danish intellectual Georg Brandes (1842–1927). The late nineteenth century also marks the rise of serious literary criticism concerning the sagas in Iceland, with Björn M. Ólsen (1850–1919) and Finnur Jónsson (1858–1934) the two giants of this period. Thus, it may not be a coincidence that the literary appreciation of the Sagas of Icelanders is highly coloured by the notion that they should be treated as realistic (or even factual). Seeing the sagas as similar to late nineteenth-century realist narratives was perhaps a natural evolution of the nineteenth-century tendency, not to mention earlier periods, to use the sagas – first, all sagas, however distant from their

Middelalder fra Vikingetid til Reformationstid VII: Hovedstad-Judar (Copenhagen, 1962), pp. 496–513, at p. 509. 5 See Theodore M. Andersson, ‘The Displacement of the Heroic Ideal in the Family Sagas’, Speculum , 45 (1970), 575–93. It is hardly an exaggeration that this article marks a paradigm shift in that the perception of the Sagas of Icelanders as ‘heroic’ has ever since remained more or less buried. 6 It is not really until the 1990s that scholars have strayed from the idea that the sagas should be seen as realism, a shift marked by e.g., Lars Lönnroth, ‘Saga and Jartegn: The Appeal of Mystery in Saga Texts’, in Stig Toftgaard Andersen (ed.), Die Aktualität der Saga: Festschrift für Hans Schottmann (Berlin and New York, 1999), pp. 111–24. See also Margaret Clunies Ross, ‘Realism and the Fantastic in the Old Icelandic Sagas’, Scandinavian Studies , 74 (2002), 443–54. 7 See, e.g., Champfleury, Le Réalisme (Paris, 1857); Hippolyte Taine, Histoire de la littérature anglaise (Paris, 1864); Luc Herman, Concepts of Realism (Columbia, SC, 1996), pp. 9–33.

subject matter, then the Sagas of Icelanders – as more or less accurate sources for the past – that is, for reality itself. 8 In the early twentieth century, the source value of the sagas had, on the other hand, been much discredited, by Swedish historian Lauritz Weibull and others, 9 and thus it became desirable for scholars wanting the sagas to enjoy a suitably prestigious reputation to reinvent them as realism rather than reality. In this paradigm, the sagas are works of art fashioned by authors whose mindsets were overwhelmingly realistic, and who were perceived to be as rationalistic as the scholars themselves. The latter tended to be highly critical of any paranormal events in the sagas and often resolved the issue by simply ignoring them, paying scant attention to fantastic elements, and dismissing them as insignificant. 10 One could even compare the mid-twentieth-century saga scholar to a sieve whose role was to filter away those naïve and embar - rassing elements and place the focus firmly on the saga’s realist narrative greatness. A good example of this tendency is Björn Sigfússon’s introduc - tion to Ljósvetninga saga in the Íslenzk fornrit series in which his chapter

8 Scholarly writing about the sagas may be said to begin in the early seventeenth century with Arngrímur Jónsson (1568–1648) using these works as sources for the early history of Iceland. This is indeed what the sagas were in the minds of seventeenth-, eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century scholars: important sources for past events. The categorisation of the sagas into sub-genres, which originates around the beginning of the nineteenth century, is strongly determined by the idea of their source value. Thus, we have Sagas of Icelanders that narrate events in Iceland from c. 870 to c. 1130, legendary sagas that are sources to Scandinavian history before the tenth century, and kings’ sagas that narrate Scandinavian events from the ninth century onwards. However, though this categorisation has almost nothing to do with the literary characteristics of those narratives, it has been used for more than a century after the source value of some of the sagas began to be seriously disputed. 9 In particular, Lauritz Weibull, Kritiska undersökningar i Nordens historia omkring år 1000 (Lund, 1911). When Weibull was writing, the source value of the legendary sagas ( fornaldarsögur ) was already seen as dubious, though not by all, but he went further and questioned the source value of the kings’ sagas and the sagas of Icelanders. To this day, these latter sagas are used by some as sources for past events. However, they are very late sources, in some cases composed four or five centuries after the events they purport to describe, in fact so late that the word ‘legendary’ now seems more apt than ‘historical’ to describe their source value. 10 The tendency to reinvent the sagas as great literature is well exemplified by Sigurður Nordal, who in his Hrafnkatla , Studia Islandica 7 (Reykjavík, 1940) did not hesitate to identify Hrafnkels saga , regarded as a well-written and classical saga, as fictitious. His most iconoclastic stance was that he dissented strongly from the hierarchy established by nineteenth-century scholars whereby fiction was inferior to history and argued that Hrafnkels saga was, while not very historical, an important work of art.

‘Genealogies and Historical Knowledge’ is followed by the chapter ‘Fiction’, which he describes as things ‘sem getur ekki stuðzt við söguleg rök’ (that cannot stand as historical evidence). 11

Thus filtered, what remained were masterpieces of realistic fiction. This was indeed satirised by the influential philologist Jón Helgason (1899–1986), writing about Egill Skalla-Grímsson’s alleged visit to York in 948, who felt that scholars tended to believe too much in the visit, even though the saga frames it carefully as caused by a magic spell: ‘Þegar fram liðu stundir þótti ekki lengur tilhlýðilegt að trúa á seið, en um leið og menn gáfust upp á því var meginstoðinni kippt undan skilningi á flani Egils til útlanda. […] Það er hæpið að trúa því að ef galdur er tekinn úr galdrasögu, verði afgangurinn sönn saga’ (In the fullness of time it was not deemed appropriate to believe in magic but when people gave up on that the foundation to understand Egill’s trip abroad was gone […] It is dubious to believe that if you take magic out of a story about magic, what remains is a true story). 12 Jón certainly hits the nail on the head in that for his scholarly contemporaries, it was this realism was indeed what made the sagas great, not prophecies or conjurations or other such fantastic elements. Despite frequent use of the ‘realism’ designation, the narrative realism of the sagas (or indeed any sort of textual realism) is far from easy to pin down, not least when it comes to a narrative from the past in which we cannot be sure that its interpretation of reality correlates with modern definitions. Opinions of what is real may vary a great deal; thus, realism must boil down to an uneasy contract between a text and its audience such that the audience chooses to believe in the reality of a narrative although it may know it is in fact fictional, as long it takes place in the ‘real world’ and refers to it. Such a contract seems also to have been in place between the Sagas of Icelanders and their original audience, with the added provision that they probably were regarded as history rather than fiction, not a possible world but the world as it probably was, with actual historical figures and situations meant to be understood as accurately portrayed by the saga narrative. Thus, the sagas are historical narratives – if we define history as a literary genre purporting to relate the past rather than producing an accurate representation of a previous reality. 13

Though artistically arranged, the sagas nonetheless demand to be taken seriously as accurate accounts of the past. As Preben Meulengracht Sørensen (1940–2001) has remarked, the Sagas of Icelanders have been cleansed of all authorial traces, more than other saga forms, which he regards as essential for the artistic illusion that they create: that they are accounts of and from the past. He has also stressed that this is indeed an artistic illusion and that their seeming orality is highly constructed. 14 To this it might be added that history as a narrative form in the Middle Ages does not necessarily demarcate clearly between a legendary and a well-documented past, and that omens, portents, and paranormal figures may well have their place in a work of medieval history. 15

To what degree the medieval audience must have believed in the factuality of the sagas is far from certain; there is scant evidence of their reaction to those nar - ratives. 16 There is always the possibility of an attitude characterised by a willing suspension of disbelief: the medieval audience believing in the reality of the saga, not out of any lack of healthy scepticism, but rather through the necessity of establishing some version of the past that had to be the accepted truth. Some of the past may be legendary, but it is still necessary, and has thus been accepted as true, in lieu of a better authenticated version. The legend can become fact. 17

In a given work of realistic fiction, and to some extent in any and all fiction, a certain degree of plausibility is required, and it is necessary to keep in mind that this applies to fantastic fiction as well. A magic ring may exist, but its guardian still encounters the same amount of trouble any wan - derer might expect when crossing a marsh or climbing a slope. The Sagas of Icelanders may be realistic in the same sense as modern fantastic fiction in that unexplained phenomena are far from excluded from the narrative. Thus, a saga may be somewhat realistic in its depiction of the human world and its everyday strife and struggles, but still have a hero that seems sometimes more bestial than human, such as Egill Skalla-Grímsson in Egils saga , the descendant of shapeshifters and half-trolls. 18

Truth-claims and Defensive Narrators in Icelandic Romance-sagas’, Mediaeval Scandinavia , 15 (2005), 101–69. 17 As the cynical newspaperman Maxwell Scott expressed it in John Ford’s film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). In his words: ‘This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes fact, print the legend’. 18 See Ármann Jakobsson, ‘Beast and Man: Realism and the Occult in Egils saga’,

So-called supernatural or paranormal elements may not make a narrative unrealistic in itself to a medieval audience. However, the term ‘realistic’ cannot even be used unless we first try to decipher what was regarded as real by the narrative’s creator and by its audience rather than what is supposed to be real according to our modern scientific understanding of the world. For those who believe in trolls, for example, the appearance of a troll hardly makes a narrative less realistic, and the idea that the demarcation between normal and paranormal can be clearly defined more or less according to our own post-medieval perceptions of reality does not seem applicable to a medieval text such as a saga. As has been demonstrated by several scholars, including the present author, there is no shortage of paranormal activity in the Sagas of Icelanders. 19 And yet their modern reception, at least among regular readers, continues to rely heavily on the concept of narrative realism – which may sometimes lead to misinterpretation of the narrative. This study will be primarily concerned with one such case, where the realistic interpretation may even become a stumbling block to understanding character depictions found in a single saga.

Fóstbrœðra saga’s Bizarre Friendship

Fóstbrœðra saga is assuredly one of the better-known Sagas of Icelanders of the late Middle Ages. Originally believed to be one of the oldest sagas, its textual history was extensively researched and re-evaluated by Jónas Kristjánsson (1924–2014) in the 1970s. 20 In the 1980s, it became the main

Scandinavian Studies , 83 (2011), 29–44. 19 Various studies highlight this, including François-Xavier Dillmann’s monumental Les magiciens dans l’Islande ancienne: études sur la représentation de la magie islandaise et de ses agents dans les sources littéraires norroises (Uppsala, 2006). See also Ármann Jakobsson, The Troll Inside You: Paranormal Activity in the Medieval North (Brooklyn, NY, 2017). In that book and in the present study I prefer the term ‘paranormal’ because to the average reader it will not suggest the Middle Ages, and thus it cannot be taken for granted and dismissed as a traditional or conventional term that can be safely deployed without intense scrutiny. The word is also preferable to terms such as supernatural , more easily and frequently connected with the Middle Ages, because it does not immediately establish the notion that the unknown phenomenon encountered is somehow above or beyond the world of the humans who encounter it. Furthermore, the stem normal in the former is preferable to the latter’s natural since the focus here is fixed upon human experience, and on human society, rather than nature, if that is envisioned, as it often is in the modern world, as all that is distinct from humanity. 20 Jónas Kristjánsson, Um Fóstbræðrasögu (Reykjavík, 1972). The three versions of the saga are the Hauksbók version (H), the Möðruvallabók version (M) and the

text used to demonstrate the Bakhtinian approach to the sagas, introduced by Helga Kress (b. 1939), in which the saga is seen as a grotesque and carnivalesque text. 21 This opened up the possibility of Fóstbrœðra saga being a satire or parody, which was reviewed in 1993 by Preben Meulengracht Sørensen. He sees the saga as a Christian and learned text and has reservations about the usefulness of the Bakhtinian approach. 22 In 1952, Fóstbrœðra saga itself had been parodied by Icelandic Nobel laureate Halldór Kiljan Laxness (1902–1998) in his acclaimed novel Gerpla , 23 and it has been argued that his satire may have influenced Fóstbrœðra saga scholarship. 24

This study will not be focused on the usefulness of the concepts of parody or satire, or even the theory of the carnival, for the interpretation of the Fóstbrœðra saga . However, it is useful to remember that Fóstbrœðra saga , in spite of being among the more recognised and respected of the sagas, is nevertheless often seen as somehow ill-fitting. For this there are various reasons, most prominently the learned ‘clauses’ in clerical style, the subject of much scrutiny by Jónas Kristjánsson. Some of these clauses refer to the number of the teeth and bones in the human body, for example, and other such information usually not found in saga narratives. 25 Another neglected aspect which may also have had a strong influence on the modern tendency to find Fóstbrœðra saga odd is the behaviour of the two main characters, in particular its hero Þorgeirr Hávarsson, one of the blood-brothers of the title. 26

Fóstbrœðra saga can be characterised as the biography of early-elev - enth-century blood-brothers, the martial Þorgeirr Hávarsson and the poetic Þormóðr Kolbrúnarskáld, who served the notable king Saint Óláfr of

Flateyjarbók version (F) and, as painstakingly set out by Jónas, scholars have dis - agreed which version best represents the supposed original. They have also argued about the age of the original, but the debate over that issue is of little consequence to the present study. 21 Helga Kress, ‘Bróklindi Falgeirs: Fóstbræðrasaga og hláturmenning miðalda’, Skírnir , 161 (1987), 271–86. 22 Preben Meulengracht Sørensen, ‘On Humour, Heroes, Morality, and Anatomy in Fóstbrœðra saga’, in Twenty-Eight Papers Presented to Hans Bekker-Nielsen on the Occasion of his Sixtieth Birthday 28 April 1993 (Odense, 1993), pp. 395–418. 23 Halldór Kiljan Laxness received the Nobel prize in literature in 1955, three years after Gerpla was published and, although he had been nominated to the prize long before that, many Icelanders saw Gerpla as his prize-winning novel. 24 Ástráður Eysteinsson, ‘Er Halldór Laxness höfundur Fóstbræðrasögu?

Norway, famously killed in 1030. The narrative begins with an introduc - tion of the saintly king, framing the protagonists as his retainers, even in theological terms: ‘váru þeir allir mest virðir af guði, er konungi líkaði bezt við’ (they were all best estimated by god who were in favour with the king). 27 After this statement follows a brief presentation of the magnate Vermundr Þorgrímsson whom they also later serve, and curiously enough a somewhat lengthy anecdote concerning Vermundr’s wife Þorbjǫrg the Stout Ólafsdóttir, of the renowned Laxdœlir family, 28 who nevertheless plays no significant role in the saga, and Grettir Ásmundarson the Strong, famous from his own saga ( Grettis saga ), who only has a brief walk-on part here. Finally, the sworn brothers themselves appear in Ch. 2, introduced as friends from early childhood. The close friendship of Þormóðr and Þorgeirr is perceived by many a modern reader as somewhat odd since to most readers they come across as very clear opposites, as will be discussed below. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the saga, they are actually said to be like minds (‘í mǫrgu skapglíkir’). It is also revealed in Ch. 2 that what they have in common is being belligerent and pugnacious. They are from an early age determined to yield to none and swear to avenge each other. The author remarks that they were more interested in the glory of this world than of the next, and goes on to remark that the ritual they undergo to become blood-brothers can be seen as pagan. 29 It is later revealed that what they also seem to have in common is being unpopular (‘eigi vinsælir’), or even being bullies (‘ekki … jafnaðarmenn’), 30 men who never back off from any brawl and are thus unpopular in the region. In fact, their hubris (‘ofsi’) is emphasised in the narrative, although Þorgeirr’s interpretation of this is that they excel in ‘hvatleika ok karlmennsku’ (boldness and manliness). 31

Þorgeirr Hávarsson is said to be the stronger of the two, ambitious and from a young age an accomplished warrior. Þormóðr is not as strong, and he soon becomes an ardent womaniser, whereas Þorgeirr, on the other hand, is

27 Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , p. 121. As already mentioned, there is a great difference between the extant versions of Fóstbrœðra saga . In this study, I will refer to the Möðruvallabók version (in the manuscript AM 132 fol., from the first half of the fourteenth century), unless otherwise stated. 28 Þorbjǫrg’s family is the subject of Laxdœla saga and she is also an important char - acter in Grettis saga . There is considerable intertextuality between thirteenth- and fourteenth-century family sagas, and Fóstbrœðra saga clearly expects its audience to be somewhat familiar with both the Laxdœlir family and Grettir the Strong. 29 Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , pp. 124–5. This is more or less the first thing the audience is told about Þorgeirr and Þormóðr after a brief description of each. 30 Björn K.

said to be ‘lítill kvennamaðr; sagði hann þat vera svívirðing síns krapts, at hokra at konum’ (not a ladies’ man since he felt he abused his manliness by stooping towards women). 32 Of the two, he is clearly the more exaggerated in his aggressive demeanour. When he hears of his father’s death, he does not show any reaction, which is followed by an interjection in learned rhetorical style about Þorgeirr’s lack of reaction. Apart from spurning women, he rarely laughs and is ‘óblíðr … hversdagsliga við alþýðu’ (usually unfriendly to everybody). 33 However, the saga also depicts him as ‘drengiligr’ (soldierly), 34

and any criticism of Þorgeirr’s character to be drawn from the saga is far from overt. For example, when he avenges his father, the narrator interjects that his heart was so secure and hard that he knew no fear, and this was due to ‘inn hæsti hǫfuðsmiður’ (the greatest smith of all) who had made Þorgeirr’s battle prowess as great as a lion (‘it óarga dýr’). 35

That the two men are terrifying and unpopular is, however, repeated several times in the saga, with the audience thus alerted to the possibility that the heroes of the narratives may be seen as villainous to others. 36 One of the versions of the saga also includes an anecdote where Þorgeirr Hávarsson decapitates a stooping man for no better reason than that his stance offered too good a chance for such a blow to let it pass. 37 This is taking bullying to a new level, likely to shock even those who would normally accept it. 38 Though the anecdote may be regarded as humorous, it would have hardly made Þorgeirr

Of course, one could see this as irony, along with Helga Kress, but, if so, it is subtle and far from overt. Possibly this boils down as a classic case of contrast between ‘the hermeneutics of faith’ and ‘the hermeneutics of suspicion’, to use concepts adum - brated by Ricoeur; see Rita Felski, ‘Critique and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion’, M/C Journal, Media culture , 15.1 (2012) http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index. php/mcjournal/article/view/431 [accessed 5 May 2021]. But how are we to imagine the medieval audience, credulous or suspicious? Bengt Holbek has argued that the symbolic interpretation seen in fairy tales, for example, is far from naïve or unsubtle; Bengt Holbek, Tolkning af trylleeventyr (Copenhagen, 1989), pp. 89–91. 36 See, e.g., Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , pp. 125, 133, 138, 140, 142, 149–50. 37 Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , pp. 156–7. This is an anecdote found only in the Flateyjarbók version of the saga. 38 This perhaps calls to mind the scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas (1990) when psychopathic gangster Tommy DeVito manages to shock and anger even his brutal and ruthless associates by shooting young bartender ‘Spider’ for no good reason. As in Goodfellas , however, the person killed is not significant enough for this unwarranted killing to have any repercussions for the killer.

seem more likeable to a medieval audience, and it is indeed off-putting to modern readers. In Þorgeirr, we thus have an unfriendly, harsh, and bellicose character who is repelled by women, is unable to smile and laugh, who is more or less hostile and unfriendly to everyone, and whose way of life entails attacking the guilty and innocent alike. One can easily imagine modern readers who would not hesitate to call him a ‘psychopath’. 39 While the saga text overtly emphasizes his courage and valiant qualities, it is hard not to wonder what a medieval Christian audience was supposed to make of this. It does seem likely that they were expected to be impressed by his battle skills, his heroic attitude to life, and his stoic reaction when faced with adversity. 40 However, medieval sagas are also infused with chivalric ideology of mercy, clemency, generosity, joy, humility, and politeness. They do not, as a rule, advocate groundless killings of innocent bystanders, and a fighter is expected to temper his aggression with the above-mentioned characteristics. As a medieval saga hero, Þorgeirr Hávarsson is certainly unlike the intelligent and sensitive Egill of Egils saga , the ironic and witty Skarpheðinn of Njáls saga , the empathic and helpful Grettir of Grettis saga , and other troublesome heroes of medieval Iceland. Þorgeirr Hávarsson’s character description is thus not only somewhat of an enigma to a modern audience but it is also hard to imagine a medieval Christian audience accepting him unequivocally, given his lack of Christian and chivalric virtues. An even stronger enigma is his blood-brother Þormóðr’s attachment to him, which is nevertheless the driving force of most of the narrative. Not only is this saga named after the blood-brothers but in its third part, after Þorgeirr’s death, it becomes more or less a revenge narrative, as Þormóðr makes it his mission and purpose in life to avenge Þorgeirr, thus proving his fidelity to his dead friend. In spite of Þorgeirr’s unlovely character, he is vigorously defended

39 The idea of the psychopath is, of course, not present in the sagas, and while scholars, if they want to say anything of value, must use modern vocabulary to talk about medieval literature, diagnosing saga characters as psychopaths is usually too simplistic to be of much use. On the other hand, it may be of some value to note that this is a common modern audience reaction to Þorgeirr Hávarsson, more so than to many other aggressive saga characters. 40 Þorgeirr’s stoicism is demonstrated by an anecdote, found only in the Flateyjarbók version of the saga, where he falls from a cliff and manages to cling to an angelica plant for a long while without calling for help; see Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , pp. 189–91. A modern audience usually finds this story humorous rather than heroic since Þorgeirr refuses to ask for help even when Þormóðr is looking for him. In the saga, the narrator, perhaps ironically, comments at the end of the anecdote that Þorgeirr was ‘óskelfr ok ólífhræddr’ (unafraid and not afraid for his own life): Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , p. 191.

by the saga narrator. Furthermore, after he is finally killed, defending himself heroically against greater numbers, thus proving his courage in death, his best friend Þormóðr spends most of the rest of his life, and the remainder of the saga, demonstrating Þorgeirr’s ability to inspire loyalty by avenging him. Thus, the lives of the two blood-brothers are intertwined before and, no less, after death. Revenge becomes the raison d’être of Þormóðr’s whole existence, until, after he has proven his allegiance to Þorgeirr, he comes to the court of St Óláfr to die in the king’s service. Clearly the audience is expected to accept this, in spite of Þorgeirr’s flawed character; if not, the plot would seem to fall apart. There is something in Þorgeirr that makes him worthy of such devotion, and the devotion itself is remarkable enough to appeal to the saga’s implied audience. Thus, the unity of Fóstbrœðra saga would seem to demand treating it not only as a revenge narrative but also, as perhaps with all such narratives, as a kind of a love story of two misfits, one of whom makes it his purpose in life to avenge the other. To the modern reader, however, their bond seems fairly incomprehensible. It is hard not to wonder what they see in each other, what loyalty Þormóðr owes to Þorgeirr, and, not least, how such an unlovable character as Þorgeirr could earn himself such devotion. One of Þorgeirr’s killers is himself killed soon after Þorgeirr’s death so Þormóðr has to go to Greenland to kill the remaining culprit, Þorgrímr the Troll, which is presented as a heroic feat in the narrative. 41 Later, at the king’s court, another man claims to have avenged Þorgeirr before Þormóðr and thus the remaining blood-brother has to present poetry about his feats to state his own case, after which the king accepts him as Þorgeirr’s most courageous and distinguished avenger. 42 After that, Þorgeirr is not mentioned again in the saga which goes on to relate Þormóðr’s heroic death in service of the king. As a revenge narrative, Fóstbrœðra saga is a tough sell to most modern readers. The audience must accept the great love and loyalty between the two protagonists as its raison d’être , and to do that they have to accept not only Þorgeirr as a figure worthy of devotion, but also that these two men who seem so different are in fact like minds whose bond is unlike any other. And yet at the end, their bond is still surpassed by Þormóðr’s devotion to his king for whom he eventually dies, demonstrating an evolution in him from Þorgeirr to St Óláfr.

The Externalised Ego

It could be argued that the audience dilemma presented above is created partly by the notion of realism, and that a more symbolic interpretation will change our perception of the story completely and lessen the oddness of the central relationship that underpins the plot. After a long tradition of reading the sagas as realistic fiction, such an interpretation is perhaps a natural impulse for the modern reader. However, that sort of reading can come up short if the reader wants insight into the text. All realistic approaches to this particular story, and the instinct of the modern reader to treat these figures as actual flesh and blood humans from the distant past, seem to leave any understanding of the two men and their relationship strangely elusive. That theirs is a kind of love story is evident and that might lead the modern reader, more accustomed to the idea of same-sex love than many previous generations, to think of them as lovers, not least since Þorgeirr has, like a Spartan warrior, such disdain for women that he refuses to associate with them. Þormóðr, womaniser though he is, still owes his greatest allegiance to Þorgeirr and, being oversexed, would perhaps also not be an unlikely candidate for any kind of romance, even with a man. Thus, it might not seem too far-fetched to cast the blood-brothers as the boreal Achilles and Patroclus, two warriors whose devotion to each other is the towering passion of their lives. Fóstbrœðra saga could then be understood as another narrative about the things we do for love, in this case the love between the two sworn brothers, partners in mischief whose shared unpopularity creates a bond that goes beyond death itself. This may not necessarily be a bad reading of the saga, and it is difficult to argue that the strong relationship between the two men must be seen as the core of the saga and cannot be explained away as ‘just friendship’. It could though still be objected that a homosocial or even a homoerotic interpretation of the blood-brothers would primarily be a way to salvage a realistic interpre - tation of the saga, as discussed above. On the other hand, it could be argued that in light of the two men’s contrasting personalities and of the peculiar problem of accepting Þorgeirr as a lovable character, let alone a lover, there might be a need to move further still from even an unusual realistic interpre - tation of Fóstbrœðra saga . The first question may be: are Þorgeirr and Þormóðr realistic characters? Should we even regard their love story as belonging to the natural world? Again, what is most striking is how one of the protagonists is characterised by extreme asperity, while the other is the Casanova of the medieval North. And yet these two cardboard heroes are so entwined that when one of them dies, avenging him becomes the other man’s somewhat unlikely mission in

life. If we abandon for the moment the idea that the audience is meant to see Þorgeirr and Þormóðr only as real people and focus instead on their possible symbolic value, it becomes more and more tempting to see them as spiritual doubles, an interpretation that transforms the interpretation of the narrative. In the blood-brothers, the audience is presented with a kind of medieval Icelandic Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, whose contrasting characters make sense only if the audience begins to think of them as one composite personality, the extremes of which are externalised in two distinct characters. 43 Such externalisation is, of course, commonplace in fairy tales and other symbolic narratives, 44 but that is not how the Sagas of Icelanders have commonly been interpreted to this day. However, if we see Fóstbrœðra saga as a symbolic story rather than reflect - ing reality, the unity of the blood-brothers becomes paramount. Þorgeirr and Þormóðr make more sense as one man: part of whom is rough and unsociable, never laughs, and is characterised by disdain for women; he is the more intro - vert part of the composite man. The other half, more social, enjoys being a womaniser and somewhat of a hedonist. Indeed, the story ends with Þormóðr, in his last battle, watching bits of his own heart come out of his body along with the arrow that has pierced it. 45 Þormóðr’s heart turns out to be big and soft, whereas before it had been stressed in one of the learned clauses of this narrative that Þorgeirr’s heart was tiny and hard. 46

43 The figure of the Doppelgänger figured strongly in eighteenth- and nineteenth-cen - tury literature and became in romanticism a popular method of exploring the perceived duality or complexity of human nature. Carl F. Keppler compiled not a history but an ‘anatomy’ of the Double in his important work The Literature of the Second Self (Tucson, 1972). He noted the significance of the age-old idea that it entails of ‘simultaneous differentiation and participation, rendered by this paradox of simultaneous objectivity and subjectivity’, and concluded that the flourishing of the literary image of the Double is fed by the hunger for ‘losing the self that one may find in it, of reconciling the opposites of twoness and oneness’: Keppler, The Literature of the Second Self , pp. 209–10. 44 Such interpretations of sagas are rare but of considerable importance, including Davíð Erlingsson’s interpretation of Göngu-Hrólfs saga , a legendary saga or a ‘Northern romance’, of the Middle Ages; see Davíð Erlingsson, ‘Fótaleysi göngu - manns: Atlaga til ráðningar á frumþáttum táknmáls í sögu af Hrólfi Sturlaugssyni, ásamt formála’, Skírnir , 170 (1996), 340–56. He also argues that realistic interpre - tations of sagas do not always do them justice. Davíð’s approach is considerably influenced by interpretations of fairy tales, influenced partly by Freud and Jung, where the focus is less on a literal truth than an abstract or projected truth of the narratives; see also Bengt Holbek, Interpretation of Fairy Tales: Danish Folklore in a European Perspective (Helsinki, 1987). 45 Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , p. 276. This narrative is only in the Flateyjarbók version of the saga. 46 Björn K. Þórólfsson and Guðni Jónsson (eds), Fóstbrœðra saga , pp. 210–11.

The Jekyll and Hyde comparison may also cast some light on the signifi - cance of the revenge motif. After Þorgeirr has been killed, Þormóðr internal - ises his dead companion, and spends the rest of his life attempting to avenge him. Having finally achieved that purpose, he immortalises his friend in a poem and enters the service of the king in order to die for him. 47 Choosing life never seems to be an option for the remaining half of the blood-brothers. However, he does end up choosing a new reason to die, the holy king himself. Thus, it does seem potentially useful to regard Þorgeirr and Þormóðr as a composite personality rather than two clearly distinct living humans. The story begins to make more sense if we see it as taking place within Þormóðr’s psyche, as a story of personal growth, of the path taken by the juvenile delinquent towards heroic death in service of the king. In the beginning, the Þorgeirr-personality is dominant, with all its dislike of the feminine, its social roughness, its egoistic disregard for human society; the lives of the blood-brothers are dominated by a juvenile misinterpretation of heroism, manliness, and bravery. After Þorgeirr is killed, Þormóðr cannot take leave of him, only cleanse his dead foster-brother through the quest for satisfaction in bloody revenge. Þorgeirr is still all-important but now only as heroic memory. Having commemorated Þorgeirr properly and devoted his life to bringing him the honour he deserves, Þormóðr can now go on to serve the king as his own new self, a brave but selfless man who dies for a cause in good spirit, with Þorgeirr-esque bravery tempered by good cheer and wit. As in a fairy tale, the message is essentially unspoken and covert but still simple and thus easily internalised by the audience, perhaps emotionally rather than intellectually, but no less accessible to a medieval audience than a modern one. This is a common reaction to all stories, but when they are presented as history, it sometimes seems less urgent to seek their symbolic or emotional truth than when the audience is knowingly digesting fairy tale or fantasy. Þorgeirr and Þormóðr are not the only brothers in narratives who essen - tially serve as doubles, in that they are two parts of the same psyche. One argument for this interpretation of the pair would be that it makes their story more satisfactory, and it releases us from the obligation of seeing Þorgeirr as nothing more than a horrible psychopath who kills people for pleasure. It also does not necessarily negate the other interpretation proposed earlier in this

47 Fóstbrœðra saga has 40 verses in the standard edition; 35 are attributed to Þormóðr and 15 have been attributed to Þorgeirsdrápa (including one which is not clearly attributed to Þormóðr in the saga). 40–50 verses have been attributed to Þormóðr in late medieval sources; see Tarrin Wills, with Margaret Clunies Ross, Kari Ellen Gade, Guðrún Nordal, Edith Marold, Diana Whaley and Hannah Burrows (eds), Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages http://skaldic.abdn.ac.uk/ db.php?if=default&table=database [accessed 20 May 2021].

essay, that the love between the blood-brothers is the defining passion of the narrative. Rather, their status as each other’s double enhances this reading, since where does love reside except in the recesses of the mind? Although in no way would it seem prudent to dismiss the idea of love as a special bond between two people – that, thankfully, can exist – there still remains the fact that love is an emotion contained largely within and emanating from the self and therefore can hardly be separated from it. This is all very well, a sceptic might say, but has not this whole exegesis strayed too far into the modern areas of psychology and reception? How does this correlate with the clerical leaning of the author or authors of Fóstbrœðra saga itself? The answer, actually, is: most satisfactorily, as I see it. As schol - ars have demonstrated, the medieval ideology of romance was created first and foremost by clerics, 48 and the most enduring medieval love stories were fashioned by learned authors. Not only were they very well-informed about interlace as a literary technique but entwining is also a firm part of the dom - inant theology of the time in that the idea of perichoresis – attempting to describe the unity and inseparability of the individual members of the holy trinity (father, son and holy ghost) who nevertheless are a trinity as well as a unity – permeated their ideological thought. 49

Conclusion

The story of Þorgeirr and Þormóðr ends up being more uplifting than the tale of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. In Fóstbrœðra saga , God and the king provide answers – as a higher truth to which the self can succumb. 50 Thus, inseparable as they are, the blood-brothers do not need to perish together. The latter half of the saga concerns precisely Þormóðr’s survival and eventual separation

Stephen Jaeger, The Envy of Angels: Cathedral Schools and Social Ideals in Medieval Europe, 950–1200 (Philadelphia, 1994). 49 Perichoresis is a term coined by early medieval theologians trying to describe the relationship between the individual members of the holy trinity (father, son and holy ghost); see, e.g., Lane G. Tipton, ‘The Function of Perichoresis and the Divine Incomprehensibility’, Westminster Theological Journal , 64 (2002), 289–306; Emmanuel Durand OP, ‘Perichoresis: A Key Concept for Balancing Trinitarian Theology’, in Giulio Maspero and Robert J. Wozniak (eds), Rethinking Trinitarian Theology: Disputed Questions and Contemporary Issues in Trinitarian Theology (London and New York, 2012), pp. 177–92. 50 On this role of St Óláfr in various sagas of Icelanders, see Bjarni Guðnason, Túlkun Heiðarvígasögu , Studia Islandica 50 (Reykjavík, 1993), pp. 45–65.

from Þorgeirr as he enters the service of the king and shares his new master’s heroic martyrdom. It seems likely that Þorgeirr, having been incorporated by his blood-brother, shared in this glory, although he is never mentioned until Þormóðr has reached the king and told him of Þorgeirr’s exploits. The story ends with just the one brother: ‘Ok lýkr hér frásǫgn þeiri, er vér kunnum at segja frá Þormóði, kappa ins helga Óláfs konungs’ (And here ends the narrative that we can relate of Þormóðr the warrior of the holy King Olaf). 51

In this interpretation, the audience is essential – in fact it is fuelled by a need for the story to make sense to its audience. Thus, it may serve as a tiny demonstration of how a medieval narrative can make sense to a modern, and possibly also to its medieval, audience. It has been argued above that sometimes a symbolic and fantastic interpretation can provide a more sat - isfactory result than the traditional focus on the supposed ‘realism’ of the sagas. To many, history and psychology are opposites, but not necessarily to the medieval mind. In fact, all particular histories were seen to have a more general dimension, and some Northern historians were demonstrably aware of this. 52 Possibly, when interpreting the medieval saga, anachronistically modern though it might first appear, this general dimension deserves to be paid more attention. There is no doubt that the rise of fantasy in the last decades has transformed literary interpretation by creating increased audience awareness of the pos - sibilities of non-realistic elements in fiction. Seeing Þormóðr and Þorgeirr as symbolic rather than realistic characters may make modern audiences appreciate them more. In its own way, a fantastic saga is no less real than a supposedly realistic one. Its reality is symbolic, but the saga must still appeal to the situation of the audience for it to make an impression. Any story about Jekyll and Hyde, including that of Þorgeirr and Þormóðr, is essentially a story of the self, and in particular the murky narratives that hide within our minds. The sagas too, much involved with the past, aiming to be history, preaching about Christian conduct and the glory of the king, are still also narratives engaged with preoccupations of the human psyche. One can only imagine its effect on the clerical author’s imagined audience, a medieval audience of impressionable youngsters for whom warriors and poets were important cultural heroes. The story is always about you, and this was as true in the year 1300 as it is in 2022.
