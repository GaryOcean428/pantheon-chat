## The Malleability of the Past:


## Íslendingabók


## as Narrative History
Martina Ceolin

Íslendingabók ( Book of Icelanders ) is a concise history of Iceland from its settlement, c. 870, to the year 1118, which was written by the priest Ari Þorgilsson inn fróði (‘the Wise’, 1067/68–1148) between the years 1122–33. The work has always been regarded as a unique source for early Icelandic history, both because of its proximity to the events described, and because of the author’s preoccupation with the reliability of his sources. This view flourished particularly during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and is still common today. However, some scholars have recently advanced the idea that there is a strongly narrative character to the work, which should also be considered. In the nineteenth and twentieth century, Iceland struggled for independence from the Kingdom of Denmark. During this time, nationalist ambitions merged with ethnic sensibilities, and the growing need of national self-definition inspired a renewed interest in historical and native subjects, though at times an uncritical one. 1 The Middle Ages, the early Icelandic historical period in particular, came to be regarded as an epoch encompassing distinctly Icelandic qualities, especially from a cultural point of view, but also from a political one, expressed by the people’s self-proclaimed ethnicity in opposition to the Norwegian crown. By some, this period was even considered the golden age

1 Gunnar Karlsson points out that the ‘first generation of professionally educated Icelandic historians was too anxious to give the Icelandic people a national history to be able to observe the time-honoured principles of source-criticism’: Gunnar Karlsson, ‘A Century of Research on Early Icelandic Society’, in Anthony Faulkes and Richard Perkins (eds), Viking Revaluations. Viking Society Centenary Symposium 14–15 May 1992 (London, 1993), pp. 15–25, at p. 16.

of Icelandic society ( gullöld Íslendinga ). 2 Therefore, it is not surprising that a work such as Íslendingabók was particularly treasured within this context, as it well satisfied nationalist criteria. Clearly, this implies that it was regarded as a reliable historical source, a tendency that crystallized during the second half of the twentieth century, especially within scholarly discussion of early Icelandic history. Jón Jóhannesson, for example, relied heavily on Íslendingabók in his work on early Icelandic history ( Íslendinga saga I , 1956), and Jakob Benediktsson, in the prologue to his influential Íslenzk fornrit edition of the text (1968), placed particular emphasis on the alleged reliability of the work as a historical source, while focusing on its chronology and on the author’s sources. 3

More recently, scholars have begun to reconsider this viewpoint, the inspiration coming from important shifts in the concerns of saga scholarship that have occurred since the 1970s. From a historical point of view, the discussions on the historical reliability of the sources shifted, under the influence of social anthropology, from considering saga descriptions as evidence of actual events towards the possibility of contemplating the same descriptions more as evidence of cultural norms, customs, and social prac - tices of the past. In other words, the texts came to be regarded as potentially valuable ethnographic sources, no matter the historical authenticity of the events they describe. 4 Furthermore, literary scholars have maintained that the very subjectivity of historical truths should not be overlooked when studying medieval Icelandic texts, and therefore that the narrative character of history should also be considered within such discussions. 5

The chief aim in this essay is to examine the production of Íslendingabók in light of these recent scholarly trends, in order to demonstrate how, by con -

2 Gullöld Íslendinga is the name of a collection of lectures published in 1906 by historian Jón Jónsson Aðils. According to Gunnar Karlsson, the collection, despite providing a good survey of written sources, is ‘totally uncritical in its use of the sagas as historical sources, and nationalistic in a way that now sounds naive and, after the age of Fascism, almost blasphemous’: Gunnar Karlsson, ‘A Century of Research on Early Icelandic Society’, p. 15. 3 Jón Jóhannesson, Íslendinga saga I.

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

sidering the text as a clearly arbitrary yet particularly biased reconstruction of the Icelandic past, more subtle elements about the text, its author, and the society in which he lived can be detected. The focus will be placed on the author’s artistry in composing the text, precisely on the strategies through which he selected specific information from the Icelandic past and shaped it into a coherent narrative that would be meaningful in his own time. Attention will also be paid to his aims and to the ideological parameters that determined his reconstruction of the past as we now have it in Íslendingabók . In this way, it will be possible to go beyond the professed objectivity of the account and the still prominent influence of the uncritical methods used to approach the work during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Additionally, light will be shed on the fact that these methods have regarded the text predominantly as a historical text of the period it describes, rather than that during which it was written. This is true not only within scholarly discussions about early Icelandic history and culture, but also in popular, contemporary attitudes towards the Icelandic Middle Ages. These aspects will be considered after an analysis of the production context of the text, its characteristics, as well as some of the specific ways in which the author constructed the text.

Behind the Text

Íslendingabók is the earliest piece of extant historiography from and about medieval Iceland, and probably the earliest history of Iceland ever written, at least in Old Icelandic. 6 Evidence for this appears in the prologue to Heimskringla (c. 1230), a collection of sagas about Norwegian kings attributed to the Icelandic poet and historian Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241), who highly admired Ari Þorgilsson. Indeed, in the prologue to the work Snorri advocates not only that Ari ‘ritaði fyrstur manna hér á landi að norrænu máli fræði bæði forna ok nýja’ (was the first man in [Iceland] to write in the Norse tongue about lore both ancient and recent), but he also describes him as forvitri (exceedingly well-informed) and námgjarn ok minnigr (eager to learn and

6 It seems that Sæmundr Sigfússon inn fróði (‘The Learned’, 1054/56–1133), a notable historian and priest who was among Ari Þorgilsson’s advisors for his Íslendingabók , composed a (now lost) historiography before Ari wrote his account, even though it was probably written in Latin and mostly about Norwegian Kings. Thus, Ari seems to have been the first to transform the Icelandic past into written history and to do so in Old Icelandic; see Pernille Hermann, ‘Spatial and Temporal Perspectives in Íslendingabók : Historiography and Social Structures’, Viking and Medieval Scandinavia , 1 (2005), 73–89, at p. 78.

endowed with an excellent memory). 7 Although Snorri probably had his own reasons for praising Ari – among them the fact that he needed to establish him as an authority to validate his own work – Ari was generally held in high regard within his community. 8 Contemporary scholars have also praised Ari on many occasions, whilst describing him as a ‘pioneer’ ( byrjandi ) in Icelandic historiography, a ‘guiding star’ ( leiðarstjarna ) in the history of the nation and as the ‘father’ of Icelandic history tout court . 9 However, at the same time, some scholars have perceived a discrepancy between Ari’s high reputation and the limited focus of his brief history. 10 Therefore, research has been conducted on Ari’s extreme selectivity. It has been hypothesized that, on the one hand, Ari’s selectivity could be ascribed to his concern for accuracy, while, on the other hand, it may also derive from his interest in the traditions of only a few prominent families, thus expressing a particular ideological viewpoint. Therefore, an exploration of the family networks appearing in the text, which in one way or another involve Ari himself, may be crucial to appreciating the nature of his work. The information we possess about Ari’s life comes mostly from Íslendingabók itself . We know he was descended from important families in Breiðafjörður and the south-east of Iceland, and in Ch. 9 Ari himself relates that at the age of seven he was sent to live in Haukadalr with Hallr Þórarinsson (b. c. 995/6), ‘sá maðr es þat vas almælt, at mildastr væri ok ágæztr at góðu á landi hér ólærðra manna’ (a man whom everyone described as the most generous layman in this country and the most eminent in good qualities). 11

Ari remained there for fourteen years, until he was twenty-one years of age (c. 1074/75 to 1088/89). Hallr also fostered Teitr Ísleifsson (c. 1040–1110), son of Ísleifr Gizurarson – the first Bishop of Iceland (Bishop of Skálholt 1056–80) – and a priest who ran a small school there, one of only four existing in Iceland

History of the Kings of Norway , trans. Lee M. Hollander (Austin, 1964), pp. 4–5. 8 For instance, the anonymous author of the First Grammatical Treatise (c. 1130–40) also praises Ari by mentioning ‘þau in spakligu frœði, er Ari Þorgilsson hefir á bœkr sett af skynsamligu viti’ (that sagacious (historical) lore that Ari Þorgilsson has recorded in books with such reasonable understanding): Hreinn Benediktsson (ed.) and (trans.), The First Grammatical Treatise (Reykjavík, 1972), pp. 208–9. 9 This includes, for example, Einar Arnórsson, Björn Sigfússon, and Gabriel Turville- Petre; see Siân Grønlie, ‘Introduction’, in Siân Grønlie (trans.), The Book of the Icelanders, The Story of the Conversion (London, 2006), pp. vii–xlvii, at p. ix. 10 Such as Eva Hagnell, Einar Arnórsson and Gabriel Turville-Petre; see Grønlie, ‘Introduction’, p. x. 11 Jakob Benediktsson (ed.), Íslendingabók , Landnámabók , p. 20; Grønlie (trans.), The Book of Icelanders , The Story of the Conversion , p. 10.

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

at the time (the others were at Skálholt, Oddi, and Hólar). It is likely that Ari was sent to Haukadalr because his mother was related to Teitr’s wife, Jórunn, and he would have been able to study at the school Teitr ran there. Teitr was a few decades older than Ari, and Ari describes him as his foster-father ( fóstri , probably including the meaning of ‘tutor’), while praising him as ‘þess manns es ek kunna spakastan’ (the wisest man I have known) (Ch. 1). Teitr had a brother, Gizurr, who succeeded their father Ísleifr as Bishop (1082–1118), and among his close collaborators was the notable historian, priest, and chieftain Sæmundr Sigfússon inn fróði (the Learned) (1054/56–1133) from Oddi and Skálholt. 12 Sæmundr had a cousin, Ketill Þorsteinsson, who was both a chief - tain and Bishop of Hólar (1122–45) and he was married to Gizurr’s daughter. Gizurr had nominated as his successor Þorlákr Runólfsson (1118–33), who was also a great-nephew of Hallr. At the start of Íslendingabók Ari explains that Sæmundr and the Bishops Ketill and Þorlákr had been his patrons and advisors for the book: ‘Íslendingabók gørða ek fyrst byskupum órum, Þorláki ok Katli, ok sýndak bæði þeim ok Sæmundi presti’ (I first wrote the Book of the Icelanders for our Bishops Þorlákr and Ketill, and I showed it both to them and to the priest Sæmundr) (Prologue). 13 Thus, we may easily suppose that the content of the book reflects the specific interests of Ari’s patrons and advisors and his own, which should be kept in mind when examining or evaluating the work. As such, it is not surprising, for example, that the text displays a certain emphasis on the introduction of Christianity and its consolidation in the country and that it includes a genealogical history of the two bishops and of Ari’s own family.

The Text

Íslendingabók is the only work specifically attributed to Ari that we now possess. Ari begins the text by personally stating ‘Íslendingabók gørða ek fyrst’ (I first wrote the Book of the Icelanders) (Prologue) and ends the second appended genealogy with the words ‘en ek heitik Ari’ (and I am called Ari). In this way, he also leaves his signature, which is hardly common practice in medieval Icelandic writing, and medieval writing more generally, even when a narrative suggests that there may be a single individual behind a text or

12 It is interesting to note that at that time religious and secular powers in Iceland had not yet been separated, which took place only a few decades later (in 1190), when, by a decree issued by the archbishop of Nidaros, chieftains were banned from taking holy orders. 13 Jakob Benediktsson (ed.), Íslendingabók , Landnámabók , p. 3; Grønlie (trans.), The Book of Icelanders , The Story of the Conversion , p. 3.

manuscript. 14 In any case, what else he may have written has been debated, though there is a general agreement among scholars that he possibly authored a number of other works, as several sources, including The First Grammatical Treatise (c. 1130–40), refer to his ‘books’ in the plural. 15

As mentioned above, in the opening lines of Íslendingabók Ari explains that the Bishops Ketill and Þorlákr and the priest Sæmundr were directly involved in the production of the text. Therefore, the book can be dated to 1122–33 based on the date of Bishop Ketill’s consecration (1122, terminus post quem ), and the date of death of both Bishop Þorlákr and Sæmundr (1133, terminus ante quem ). More precisely, Ari’s work on the text probably began near the beginning of that period, while the text we now have seems to be a revised version that was composed before 1133:

Íslendingabók gørða ek fyrst byskupum órum, Þorláki ok Katli, ok sýndak bæði þeim ok Sæmundi presti. En með því at þeim líkaði svá at hafa eða þar viðr auka, þá skrifaða ek þessa of et sama far, fyr útan áttartǫlu ok konunga ævi, ok jókk því es mér varð síðan kunnara ok nú es gerr sagt á þessi en á þeiri.

(I first wrote the Book of the Icelanders for our bishops Þorlákr and Ketill, and I showed it both to them and to the priest Sæmundr. And in so far as it pleased them to keep it as it was or to add to it, I wrote this on the same subject besides the genealogies and regnal years of kings, and I added what has since become better known to me and is now more fully reported in this book than the other.) 16

14 This is the case, for example, of the endings of both Brennu-Njáls saga and Finnboga saga ramma in Möðruvallabók (AM 132 fol.), where the expression ‘and there I conclude the saga of’, can be found ( og lýk ég þar Brennu-Njáls sögu and og lýk ég þar Finnboga sögu ); see Handrit.is https://handrit.is/is/manuscript/view/AM02-0132 [accessed 20 May 2021]. I also thank Professor Fjodor Uspenskij for the detail con - cerning Ari’s signature, which was pointed out during the ‘Time, Space and Narrative in Medieval Icelandic Literature’ conference held in Reykjavík in March 2017. 15 Besides Íslendingabók , it seems probable that Ari also wrote some kind of report about the Kings of Norway, and that he took part in the compilation of the first Landnámabók ( Book of Settlements ) preserved in a number of versions of which the oldest is Sturlubók , compiled by Sturla Þórðarson (d. 1284); see Jónas Kristjánsson, Eddas and Sagas. Iceland’s Medieval Literature , trans. Peter Foote (Reykjavík, 2007), pp. 125–7. A short biography of the prominent chieftain Snorri goði Þorgrímsson ( Ævi Snorra goða ) and a list of Icelandic priests from 1143 (printed with commentary in Jón Sigurðsson, Jón Þórkelsson, Páll Eggert Ólasson, and Björn Þorsteinsson (eds), Diplomatarium Islandicum , 16 vols (Copenhagen, 1857–1972), vol. 1, pp. 180–94) are each also sometimes attributed to Ari; see Grønlie, ‘Introduction’, p. xiii. 16 Jakob Benediktsson (ed.), Íslendingabók , Landnámabók , p. 3; Grønlie (trans.), The Book of Icelanders , The Story of the Conversion , p. 3.

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

In this way, Ari informs his audience that the alleged earlier version of the text contained the renowned ‘ættartala ok konunga ævi’ (genealogies and regnal years of kings) – probably notes on kings’ names and dates of office rather than full biographies – which he apparently excluded from the second and extant version of the text at the suggestion of his patrons. If we accept this statement of Ari’s as true, we may suppose that he excluded the information about kings from the existing version of the work to accord it a more Icelandic tone. However, the above-mentioned passage is not entirely clear, and doubt has been cast on whether Ari ever wrote those genealogies at all and on whether an earlier version of the text itself ever existed. Indeed, some have assumed that Ari’s mention of the earlier version might be simply a familiar medieval humility topos employed to demonstrate his modesty and obsequiousness towards higher authorities. 17 Whatever the case may be, Íslendingabók , as we now have it, is all we have that is definitively attributed to Ari. It should furthermore be noted, however, that the text as we now have it is not attested in any surviving medieval manuscripts. It is found complete only in two seventeenth-century paper copies (AM 113a and 113b fol.) made by Rev. Jón Erlendsson of Villingaholt (south-west of Iceland) from a now- lost medieval manuscript dating around 1200, itself a copy of Ari’s work. How close that manuscript was to Ari’s ‘original’ text is impossible to say, since we have copies of one medieval manuscript only, but it is generally assumed that the two paper copies give ‘a good picture’ of the author’s ‘original’ work , as there seems to be no reason to suspect that the text was altered or damaged in transmission. 18

Aðalsteinsson, Under the Cloak: A Pagan Ritual Turning Point in the Conversion of Iceland (Reykjavík, 1999), p. 55. There seems to be at least one exception, which con - cerns the following passage from the prologue: ‘en hvatki es missagt es í frœðum þessum, þá es skylt at hafa þat heldr, es sannara reynisk’, which has been translated as ‘but whatever is incorrectly stated in these records, it is one’s duty to prefer what proves to be more accurate’: Grønlie (trans.), The Book of Icelanders, The Story of the Conversion , p. 3. According to Jón H. Aðalsteinsson, ‘Ari never wrote in Íslendingabók that he had missagt anything at all’, missagt being a corruption of Ari’s original wording nú sagt (now stated) that he attributes to Árni Magnússon (1663–1730): Jón H. Aðalsteinsson, Under the Cloak , pp. 182–3. In his estimation, Árni’s authority allowed for the ‘unfair distortion’ missagt to survive for centuries, and the reading can still be found in the authoritative Íslenzk fornrit edition, while the lectio nú sagt has been relegated to the critical apparatus.

As previously mentioned, Ari’s Íslendingabók spans 250 years of early Icelandic history, beginning with the settlement of Iceland and extending to events of the author’s own time, in particular to the death of Bishop Gizurr Ísleifsson in 1118. This all is condensed in the following ten brief chapters, listed in the work itself along with a prologue and two genealogical accounts, one of the bishops’ ancestors and the other of Ari’s own:

Prologus (Prologue)

1. Frá Íslands byggð (On the settlement of Iceland)

2. Frá landnámsmǫnnum ok lagasetning (On the settlers and the establishment of laws)

3. Frá alþingssetning (On the establishment of the Althing)

4. Frá misseristali (On the calendar)

5. Frá fjórðungadeild (On the division into Quarters)

6. Frá Grœnlands byggð (On the settlement of Greenland)

7. Frá því, es kristni kom á Ísland (On how Christianity came to Iceland)

8. Frá byskupum útlendum (On foreign bishops)

9. Frá Ísleifi byskupi (On Bishop Ísleifr)

10. Frá Gizuri byskupi (On Bishop Gizurr)

Ættartala (Genealogy)

As the text concerns real events in the natural world, i.e., it is ‘referential’, it has often been considered historical without question, supported by the fact that the events are presented chronologically and, apparently, in an objective way. Concerning the chronological presentation of the events, several dating patterns are used. Absolute AD dates, designating non-Icelandic events, are used as a reference to date Icelandic events, which also happen to be dated in conjunction with other Icelandic events mentioned in the book or in relation to the period of office of Icelandic lawspeakers. Genealogies also complement the complex chronological structure of the book. Such a mixture of patterns may be accounted for by assuming that Ari, being the first to write down a history of Iceland and therefore not having a model to follow, reproduced the patterns he acquired from his sources without converting one into the other. 19

Concerning the objective presentation of the events, Ari’s sources play a key role. He consulted Latin historiographical texts, which he drew on for both

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

chronology and style. 20 A certain saga about St Edmund, king of the Angles, is the only written source he refers to explicitly in the text (Ch. 1). 21 A few other sources have been hypothesized, such as Adam of Bremen’s church history ( Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum , c. 1073–76) and the work of the Venerable Bede, notably his ecclesiastical history ( Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum , c. 730), while it seems that Ari knew and used Sæmundr’s work as well. 22 It is remarkable, though, to acknowledge that despite drawing on Latin historiography, Ari decided to write his book in Icelandic and not in Latin, the official language of Christian learned men. Thus, the text was devised for and restricted to an Icelandic audience, rather than for a more international audience of Latinists. Apart from these few written works, it is reasonable to think that Ari’s sources had been mainly oral. Not only does he specify several of his inform - ants by name (e.g., ‘svá sagði Teitr oss’ (Teitr told us so), Ch. 2), but he also vouches for the reliability of the given information by praising the respective informants as, for example, spakr, margspakr (wise), óljúgfróðr (reliably informed), minnigr (having a reliable memory), or ólyginn (truthful). In this way, Ari at least tries to give the impression that he is not narrating from a subjective point of view, and therefore that what he is relating is an impartial and truthful account of Icelandic history. The oldest of his informants was the above-mentioned Hallr Þórarinsson of Haukadalr, who was probably born in 995/6 and was almost eighty years old when Ari came to live with him . Ari describes him as a man ‘es bæði vas minnigr ok ólyginn ok munði sjalfr þat es hann vas skírðr […] þrevetran’ (who both had a reliable memory and was truthful and remembered himself being baptized […] at three years old) (Ch. 9). Among his authorities was also Þuríðr Snorradóttir (c. 1025–1112), the daughter of Snorri goði Þorgrímsson, a

20 This is evidenced by Ari’s handling of subordinate clauses and the use of paired synonyms such as at ætlun ok tölu (according to the opinion and reckoning). The presence of a prologue and the division into chapters with titles are also evidence of his Latinate style, while various Latin words, such as rex and obiit , and other Latin phrases at times also appear in the text; see Diana Whaley, ‘A Useful Past: Historical Writing in Medieval Iceland’, in Margaret Clunies Ross (ed.), Old Icelandic Literature and Society (Cambridge, 2000), pp. 161–202, at p. 170. 21 This was probably a Latin life of St Edmund, but it is not certain whether it was Abbo of Fleury’s Passio of Sancti Eadmundi (The Martyrdom of St Edmund, c. 980–90), Hermannus’ De miraculis Sancti Eadmundi (The Miracles of St Edmund), or some other version of the story; see Grønlie (trans.), The Book of Icelanders , The Story of the Conversion , p. 16. 22 Stefanie Würth, ‘Historiography and Pseudo-History’, in Rory McTurk (ed.), A Companion to Old-Norse Icelandic Literature and Culture (Oxford, 2005), pp. 155–72, at p. 158.

prominent chieftain who played a central role in the acceptance of Christianity in Iceland. We know Þuríðr herself was born only twenty-five years after the Conversion, and Ari describes her as margspǫk ok óljúgfróð (both wise in many things and reliably informed) (Ch. 1). Ari also often mentions as a source Teitr Ísleifsson (c. 1040–1110), his foster-father and teacher whom he held in high regard, not least because he was son of the first Bishop of Iceland, Ísleifr, whose father, Gizurr the White, also played a prominent role in the acceptance of Christianity in Iceland. As approximately only two familial generations might cover the distance between events around the year 1000 and the time at which Ari was writing Íslendingabók , it is in principle possible that his informants had been relating accurate information. However, this does not entirely seem to be the case, not only because the account is demonstrably biased, as we have seen, but also because its style bears few marks of the influence of oral tradition. Indeed, as Pernille Hermann writes, the text is a highly literary work lacking ‘stylistic features connected with orality and mnemonic effort such as alliteration, asso - nance and rhythmic construction. […] But the form and style do guarantee that if oral traditions form the background of [the work], then once written and transformed into a new medium the oral traditions assumed a radically new form’. 23 Thus, the selection of the material presented in the book, the way in which it is presented, and the perspectives of Ari’s informants, not least his own and those of his patrons, all serve to strengthen the assumption that the text is a constructed and biased narrative of the Icelandic past, one that was meaningful in the author’s own day.

Past and Present

It is now commonly believed that representations of the past provide more indications about the time in which they were conceived rather than about the past they purport to mediate. Indeed, when specific information from the past is mediated – perhaps modified or even invented – it is because this information means something to the people who collect it, rather than simply representing a report of past phenomena. Thus, in any period, contemporary needs and aspirations influence the ways in which we investigate the past and the reasons why we do it in a specific way, while usually drawing on standard patterns and expectations in terms of its representation. 24

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

Clearly, the past can take many forms, as there are obviously various ways in which different individuals and groups of people remember or wish to remember or represent their pasts, while every individual can be part of multiple cultural environments that exist within each community. In addition, the past is always ‘open’ to social reconsideration and manipulation. Thus, explorations and reassessments of the past allow not only for heterogeneity but also for malleability, while ensuring both continuity and transformation. Literary means enable one to express the many voices of the past and give them a specific meaning. Thus, representing the past is ‘a transforming and creative activity’, not merely the direct recording of facts from the past. 25

In the Middle Ages, the past was constantly being constructed, reshaped, or re-contextualized by each generation into a new framework that would give the past meaning in the present, notably to explain and legitimize the current ordering of things for contemporary and future generations. Thus, in the com - position of historical texts medieval writers selected specific facts or segments of information from the past because they were particularly relevant to them in the present. The selection process depended on contemporary needs and aspirations, while also being ideological in that the past was interpreted using pre-existing paradigms. It is important to note that the creative process of revisiting or shaping the past began long before the written versions of these histories were produced, with the constant restructuring that the previous oral transmissions and transformation of the same information required. 26

Accordingly, in his Íslendingabók Ari Þorgilsson fashions selected frag - ments of the past into a coherent whole that would be meaningful in the present (i.e., twelfth-century Iceland) and would orientate both contemporary

and future generations. His own needs and aspirations and those of his patrons determine why and how he revisits the past, while he narrativizes it by drawing on standard patterns and expectations. What were those needs and aspirations and the ideological paradigms determining his specific reconstruction of the past? What were the mechanisms through which this was accomplished and how far could they be manipulated by wielders of cultural and political power such as Ari’s patrons and he himself? Each chapter of the work is illustrative of certain of these impulses, including chapter one, relating the settlement of Iceland, and chapter seven, concerning the Conversion to Christianity, both of which will now be briefly analysed to demonstrate this aspect of Ari’s work.

The Settlement (Ch. 1)

Chapter one of Íslendingabók briefly describes the settlement of Iceland. From the text we understand, among other elements, that a Norwegian called Ingólfr was the first man to settle in Iceland, and that

[í] þann tíð vas Ísland viði vaxit á miðli fjalls ok fjǫru. Þá váru hér menn kristnir, þeir es Norðmenn kalla papa, en þeir fóru síðan á braut, af því at þeir vildu eigi vesa hér við heiðna menn, ok létu eptir bœkr írskar ok bjǫllur ok bagla; af því mátti skilja, at þeir váru menn írskir. En þá varð fǫr manna mikil mjǫk út hingat ýr Norvegi…

([at] that time, Iceland was covered with woods between the mountains and the seashore. There were then Christians here, whom the Northmen call papar , but they later went away, because they did not wish to stay here with the heathens; and they left behind them Irish books and bells and staffs. From this it could be seen that they were Irish men. And then a great many people began to move out here from Norway…) 27

The account has the appearance of an origin myth, and indeed a certain bias in reconstructing the history of the Settlement can be detected. Ari’s statement that, at the time of Settlement, Iceland was covered with trees between the mountains and the shore is still debated, and, in any case, the way in which the information is presented and contextualized here is also somewhat mythic. Indeed, Ari creates the impression that the first settlers migrated from Norway over the sea and arrived in a paradisal land, fertile and entirely wooded, thus

apparently pristine and therefore also culturally available. 28 However, Ari also portrays the land as already inhabited, but only by a few specific people, namely the Christian papar (popes, priests), Irish monks following the custom of peregrinatio , whereby they renounced their homeland and wandered in solitude ‘for the love of God’. Ari’s statement that they left Iceland as soon as the Norwegians arrived, because they did not wish to stay there with heathen people, has been much discussed. Other sources such as Landnámabók (‘The Book of Settlements’, twelfth to thirteenth century, Ch. 323 in Sturlubók ) and Kristni saga (‘The Story of the Conversion’, early–mid-thirteenth century, Ch. 8) relate, for example, that ‘there had been Christians at Kirkjubær in the south continuously from the time of settlement’. 29 There is no reason to doubt that Irish hermits lived in Iceland when the Norwegians arrived. 30 That they left when the settlers arrived also seems plausible, as they could no longer live in solitude once the island was being settled. But Ari prefers to relate that they left for religious and ideological reasons. In this way, he can depict the period following the hermits’ departure as potentially Christian, or as a time during which Christianity is inactive for a while until ‘it will manifest itself again at the right time’. 31 Thus, he incorporates the pagan past into the twelfth-century Christian present, while creating a cultural myth that depicts in the best possible way Iceland’s pagan past. The fact that the Irish hermits leave objects behind them (‘books, bells and staffs’) as they go away contributes to the construction of this myth, as the land is portrayed not only as already Christian ( terra christiana ) when the first settlers arrive, but also as already consecrated. 32 Ari’s emphasis on the

Historical and Literary Contacts. A Survey of Research (Reykjavík, 2000), pp. 24–5. However, not much support comes from archaeology. There are nearly two hundred artificial cave sites in the south of Iceland, and since the early twentieth century some scholars have related some of these sites to settlements of papar , especially because of the cross sculptures that have been found in some of them. Conversely, ‘more recent workers are cautious of such ideas, instead stressing that the caves are ripe for research’: Kristján Ahronson, Into the Ocean: Vikings, Irish, and Environmental Change in Iceland and the North (Toronto, 2015), pp. 77, 203. 31 Hermann, ‘ Íslendingabók and History’, pp. 27–8. 32 It has been assumed that these ‘books’ were biblical texts, probably of the kind mentioned in a passage of Landnámabók ( Sturlubók , Ch. 15) which concerns Irish Christian artifacts. Among these artifacts is a book named plenarium , containing

apparently exclusive Norwegian descent of the Icelanders is also remarkable if compared with accounts of the origins of the settlers in other sources, such as Landnámabók , where Gaelic settlers, for instance, are also included. 33 This may indicate that Ari deliberately simplifies the question of the origins of the settlers to provide his people with a distinct geographical origin, Norway. Moreover, by connecting the Icelanders with Norwegian nobility, he is able to disprove ‘accusations’ made by foreigners that they were descended from slaves, most of whom, within the Icelandic context, would have been Gaelic. 34

biblical texts; see Ásdís Egilsdóttir, ‘Saints, Books, and Textual Culture in Medieval Iceland’, in Michael Borgolte and Bernd Schneidmüller (eds), Hybride Kulturen im mittelalterlichen Europa: Vorträge und Workshops einer Frühlingsschule (Berlin, 2010), pp. 215–26, at p. 216. As to ‘bells’, some have been found in tenth-cen - tury graves, ‘but they tell us little about Irish hermits’: Gísli Sigurðsson, Gaelic Influence in Iceland , p. 24; see also Kristján Eldjárn, ‘Bjöllurnar frá Kornsá og Brú’, Árbók Hins íslenzka fornleifafélags , 63 (1966), pp. 67–70. The ‘staffs’, given as baglar in the text (sg., bagall , a loanword from Irish bachall , lat., baculus ), may have indicated abbots’ staffs or the walking sticks of mendicant friars; see Jakob Benediktsson (ed.), Íslendingabók, Landnámabók , p. 5. 33 Of the names given in Landnámabók , only about 2% are Gaelic. However, the work is most likely to name only independent and predominantly male settlers and to disregard other people of Gaelic extraction such as the wives of Norwegian set - tlers and slaves, who may nevertheless have been given Norse names. Furthermore, Landnámabók probably mentions only 5% of Iceland’s first settlers, which may have totalled as many as 20,000 by the end of the Settlement period (AD 930). Speculations based on these data, haphazard as they may be, resulted in estimations of 30–40% of the first inhabitants in Iceland having been of Gaelic origin; see Gísli Sigurðsson, Gaelic Influence in Iceland , pp. 24–40. Recent genetic analyses have supported these estimations, while also acknowledging the variable of gender imbalance. Indeed, it seems that around 20% of Iceland’s male settlers were Gaelic (the other 80% having Scandinavian/Nordic European origins), as opposed to 60% of women settlers being Gaelic (the other 40% having Scandinavian/Nordic European origins); see Agnar Helgason, ‘Uppruni Íslendinga.Vitnisburður Erfðafræðinnar’, in Árni Björnsson and Hrefna Róbertsdóttir (eds), Hlutavelta tímans. Menningararfur á Þjóðminjasafni (Reykjavík, 2004), pp. 48–55, at p. 54; Agnar Helgason et al ., ‘Estimating Scandinavian and Gaelic Ancestry in the Male Settlers of Iceland’, The American Journal of Human Genetics , 67 (2000), 697–717, at p. 697. 34 We find mention of this in the Þórðarbók version of Landnámabók , which was written sometime before 1670, although the passage in question may have been taken from Ari’s original version of the work. The passage goes as follows: ‘Þat er margra manna mál, at þat sé óskyldr fróðleikr at rita landnám. En vér þykjumsk heldr svara kunna útlendum mǫnnum, þá er þeir bregða oss því, at vér séim komnir af þrælum eða illmennum, ef vér vitum víst várar kynferðir sannar, svá ok þeim mǫnnum, er vita vilja forn frœði eða rekja ættartǫlur, at taka heldr at upphafi til en hǫggvask í mitt mál, enda eru svá allar vitrar þjóðir, at vita vilja upphaf sinna landsbyggða eða hvers<u> hvergi til hefjask eða kynslóðir’: Jakob Benediktsson (ed.), Íslendingabók, Landnámabók , p. 336 (People often say that writing about the Settlements is irrele -

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

However, by emphasizing the exclusive Norwegian descent of the Icelanders, Ari could also be simply restating the dominant cultural myth of his own time. In any case, in Ari’s work the Settlement is charged with a specific meaning through the construction of a narrative capable of explaining the origin of Icelandic culture and of creating an identity for the Icelanders, that is, Ari devises a myth of origin. Indeed, as Jonas Wellendorf writes,

a traditional myth of origin will tell us how a particular group [usually the dominant] wishes to conceptualize its own genesis, and in this sense the interpretation of the past that is presented forms an important part of the present identity of that group. It might seek its content from the past, but the message and values transmitted are those of the present. 35

Accordingly, Ari’s account of the origins of the Icelanders is not pure doc - umentation reflecting authentic traditions, but a version of the same which he devised via the selection and manipulation of information according to present needs and wishes. By doing so, he not only established a sense of con - tinuity between past and present, but he also handed down a specific picture of the Settlement and the settlers. Therefore, Íslendingabók can be regarded a foundation narrative, that is a ‘narrative about the past that orientates people in time and space, and which has normative and formative power’ in Ari’s contemporary, twelfth-century Iceland, but also into the future. 36

There is ample evidence in the medieval Icelandic sagas, for example, notably in the Íslendingasögur , that their writers inherited traditions from Ari, such as the link between migration to Iceland and King Harald Fairhair, as well as the way in which Ari depicted the Conversion to Christianity. Concerning the former, Ari’s account of the consistent migration of people

vant learning, but we think we can better meet the criticism of foreigners when they accuse us of being descended from slaves or scoundrels, if we know for certain the truth about our ancestry. And for those who want to know ancient lore and how to trace genealogies, it’s better to start at the beginning than to come in at the middle. Anyway, all civilized nations want to know about the origins of their own society and the beginnings of their own race): Hermann Pálsson and Paul Edwards (trans.), The Book of Settlements. Landnámabók (Winnipeg, 1972), p. 6. 35 Jonas Wellendorf, ‘The Interplay of Pagan and Christian Traditions in Icelandic Settlement Myths’, Journal of English and Germanic Philology , 109:1 (2010), pp. 1–21, at p. 3; cf. Hermann, ‘Founding Narratives and the Representation of Memory in Saga Literature’, pp. 73–4, relating a similar sentiment, and Kirsten Hastrup, Island of Anthropology: Studies in Past and Present in Iceland (Odense, 1990), pp. 15–20, maintaining that ‘recollections are – by definition – marked by contemporary significance and experience’. 36 Hermann, ‘Founding Narratives and the Representation of Memory in Saga Literature’, pp. 70, 73–4.

to Iceland during the reign of King Harald Fairhair is often exploited by saga writers, notably by writers of the Íslendingasögur , to provide the set - tlers whom they describe with a recognizable background, while setting up a traditional scene (e.g., Laxdæla saga , Ch. 2). 37 As to the depiction of the Conversion to Christianity, there are sagas which follow Ari’s tendency to portray it more as a legal compromise than a change of faith, notably Njáls saga (thirteenth century, Ch. 105). 38 It is now precisely this aspect of Ari’s work which will now be explored.

The Conversion to Christianity (Ch. 7)

The portrayal of the Conversion to Christianity in chapter seven supports the thesis that Íslendingabók may be seen as a reconstruction of the past, that is as a text with specific, often detectable intentions on the part of the author, rather than as an objective recording of facts. It constitutes the longest and most detailed account within the narrative and scholars have often interpreted it as evidence for Ari’s eagerness to construct an Icelandic Christian identity. 39

However, the chapter is complex and seems to convey further information about the Conversion, which most of the time can be detected indirectly. Indeed, by exploring how Ari either selected, manipulated, or omitted specific information about the Conversion, it becomes evident how his account is anything but an authoritative version of the Conversion history. In the text, we are told that just before the year 1000 the Norwegian King Óláfr Tryggvason – who played a prominent role in the conversion of the Nordic world to Christianity – orders an expedition to Iceland to convert the Icelanders. The mission fails due to strong opposition from the pagans, but the king’s rage at the news of its failure makes two Icelanders, Gizurr the White, father of Ísleifr the first Bishop of Iceland, and Hjalti Skeggjason, promise him to carry out his plan. They deliver the king’s message at the Alþingi (National Assembly), where the tension between the pagans and those who have already converted to Christianity is at its highest. Then Ari tells us that the chieftain Hallr Þorsteinsson (of Síða), one of those who had by then converted to Christianity and was asked by the Christians to announce the verdict, instructs the lawspeaker Þorgeirr Þorkelsson of Ljósavatn, still a pagan, to take over and accomplish the task:

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

En síðan es menn kvómu í búðir, þá lagðisk hann niðr Þorgeirr ok breiddi feld sinn á sik ok hvílði þann dag allan ok nóttina eptir ok kvað ekki orð. En of morguninn eptir settisk hann upp ok gørði orð, at menn skyldi ganga til lǫgbergis. […] Þá vas þat mælt í lǫgum, at allir menn skyldi kristnir vesa…

(And later, when everyone had returned to their booths, Þorgeirr lay down and spread his cloak over himself, and rested all that day and the following night, and did not speak a word. And the next morning, he got up and sent word that people should go to the Law-Rock […]. It was then proclaimed in the laws that all people should be Christian…) 40

The spiritual significance of the pagan lawspeaker Þorgeirr going ‘under the cloak’ to arrive at his decision seems palpable but remains somewhat obscure. Nevertheless, this mystical episode allows Ari to portray the Icelanders as choosing of their own free will to become Christian, by taking at least the final step towards embracing the new faith, even though the conversion was ordered by King Óláfr. 41 In addition, the decision is made by a pagan, who is therefore pictured as a wise man from a Christian point of view, as is often the case for pagans in the work. In turn, this contributes to demonstrating how the pre-Chris - tian past was rationalized and peacefully incorporated into Ari’s present. 42

However, the picture slightly changes if we consider the account of the Conversion as it appears in other medieval Icelandic sources, such as Kristni saga and Njáls saga . In those texts Þorgeirr is said to have been paid (with

40 Jakob Benediktsson (ed.), Íslendingabók , Landnámabók , pp. 16–17; Grønlie (trans.), The Book of Icelanders , The Story of the Conversion , p. 9. 41 Mundal, ‘ Íslendingabók ’, pp. 111, 118–9. Scholars have also tried to explain Ari’s account of Þorgeirr’s behaviour in this context. According to some (e.g., Konrad Maurer, Björn M. Ólsen, Jón Jóhannesson, and Sigurður Nordal) Þorgeirr lay awake all night under his cloak, while ‘pondering over his task, the contents of the law or the promulgation speech’. Others have maintained that he looked for inspiration in his isolation like poets, or to gain information from distant places. Among them, for example, is Jón H. Aðalsteinsson, who has maintained that ‘Þorgeirr did not lie under his cloak to think but in order to carry out an ancient soothsaying ritual and to search into the future’, thus seeking an oracle, which would also make it ‘easier to understand why the assembled pagans accepted his decision’ of converting to Christianity: Jón H. Aðalsteinsson, Under the Cloak , pp. 141–3. 42 Hermann, ‘ Íslendingabók and History’, pp. 27–8. See also Lars Lönnroth’s concept of the ‘the Noble Heathen’, a theme that is recurrent, especially in the sagas. According to Lönnroth, this common theme consists of ‘a pagan hero [who] is shown in a situation where he appears to be a sort of precursor, or herald, of Christianity, at the same time retaining enough of the pagan ethics to emphasize the difference between the old and new religion’: Lars Lönnroth, ‘The Noble Heathen: A Theme in the Sagas’, Scandinavian Studies , 41:1 (1969), 1–28, at pp. 2–5.

sixty ounces of silver in Kristni saga , Ch. 12), if not bribed (with three marks of silver in Njála , Ch. 105), by the Christian Hallr to announce the new faith. If at all reliable, Ari may have consciously omitted this detail at the suggestion of the Bishops or simply because he did not wish to compromise Hallr, from whom he was directly descended. 43 Furthermore, despite mentioning the fact that King Óláfr held the Icelanders that were in Norway hostage and would kill them were the Icelanders not to convert to Christianity, Ari does not specify that those hostages were the sons of prominent Icelanders, as Kristni saga (Ch. 11), Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta (Ch. 218), and Laxdæla saga (Ch. 41) all relate. This may be a more likely reason why the pagans renounced fighting against the Christians at the Alþingi . 44

Ari also does not mention the first two unsuccessful attempts to convert the Icelanders to Christianity, the one undertaken by Þorvaldr viðförli (the Far-Traveller) and the Saxon Bishop Friedrich, who arrived in Iceland in 981 and left after five years ( Kristni saga , Ch. 1), and the other ordered by King Óláfr Tryggvason to Stefnir Þorgilsson in 996 ( Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar en mesta , c. 1300, Ch. 143), which even worsened the situation, antagonizing many people. 45 Ari may have omitted some or all of these details for the sake of concision, but it may also be the case that he left them out so as not to spoil the image of the Conversion by stressing the pagans’ resistance to becoming Christian. Another detail Ari seems to omit in relation to the acceptance of Christianity in Iceland is the fact that the first Icelandic Bishop, Ísleifr Gizurarsson (1006– 80), encountered many problems in his relations with Icelandic chieftains, and it is possible that Ari left such details out so as not to blemish the role of the bishops as leaders in Icelandic society, as he depicts them in the work. 46

Moreover, Ari may have omitted such details because the bishops that were his patrons and advisors for the book, Þorlákr and Ketill, were in some way or another connected with Bishop Ísleifr’s son Gizurr, while Bishop Ísleifr was the father of Ari’s tutor, Teitr.

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

Silence can be informative if it is deliberate. However, it is difficult to decide how to consider Ari’s many apparent omissions since, even though there is evidence of the existence of longer and fuller traditions, it is also possible that they originated at a later stage. In any case, Íslendingabók as we now have it allows us to trace at least some of Ari’s biases in reconstructing the history of the Conversion, while also enabling us to speculate about the ideologies lying behind his interpretation and depiction of those facts. Christian ideology must have clearly shaped his view, but his depiction of the Conversion seems to reveal a secular standpoint as well. In fact, some have maintained that Ari seems to be more interested in the Conversion from a legal and institutional point of view rather than from a religious perspective, possibly appreciating it more as a change of the way society is ordered. 47

Indeed, he tells us very little about Icelandic heathenism, and he focuses more on the threat of civil war than on the spiritual dangers of heathenism. While stressing the fact that Christianity is announced in the laws, he depicts the Conversion more as a legal compromise, whereby the law seems to be the only and most significant source of social unity:

…hǫfum allir ein lǫg ok einn sið. Þat mon verða satt, es vér slítum í sundr lǫgin, at vér monum slíta ok friðinn.

(let us all have the same law and the same religion [Christianity]. It will prove true that if we tear apart the law, we will also tear apart the peace.) 48

Moreover, these words are attributed to the pagan Þorgeirr, while reflecting a common kind of proverb found, for example, in Kristni saga (Ch. 12) and in Njáls saga (Ch. 70). 49

Thus, the view of some scholars that Ari’s work reflects his eagerness to portray Iceland as part of the Christian world does not entirely seem to be the case, which is supported by the fact that the text bears little resemblance to European Christian literature. 50 In this regard, it is notable, for example, that ‘miracles, religious rhetoric and moral exempla’, which usually abound in con - version stories such as in Kristni saga , are actually absent from Íslendingabók ,

MARTINA CEOLIN

and the work was written in Icelandic and not in Latin, the official language of the Church. 51 Moreover, the lack of information about the Church outside of Iceland, notably about the Scandinavian Church, may be seen as evidence of the fact that in Íslendingabók Ari does not ‘see his own church as a localised component of the Universal Church’ or as an autonomous entity, but more ‘as a secular institution within Icelandic society’. 52 Supporting this view is also the remarkable fact that the characteristics of the bishops highlighted by Ari are social rather than religious, even though it should be remembered that at that time the Icelandic Church was dominated by secular interests, and that the first attempts to separate secular and ecclesiastical power did not take place until later during the episcopates of St Þorlákr Þórhallsson (1178–93) and Bishop Guðmundr Arason (1203–37). Ari’s depiction of the Conversion to Christianity as a legal and political process, more than a religious one, was among the traditions that later saga writers inherited, such as the writer of Njáls saga , as seen previously, while it contributes to strengthen the thesis that the text is a reconstruction of the past with a clear ideological project behind it, as once again Ari seems to have selected, manipulated, and omitted information at will.

Conclusion

In Íslendingabók , Ari Þorgilsson, the first to write a history of the Icelanders in his own tongue, demonstrably fashioned selected fragments of the past into a coherent whole according to his patrons’ and his own needs and aspirations. His account had an impact not only in the present, but also on future genera - tions of Icelandic writers, as we know many among his contemporaries and successors held him in high regard, while there is evidence that some among them also used his work as a model. Thus, by manipulating the past, Ari was not only able to shape it, but also to influence how it was to be remembered and exploited by future generations. This was an act of power, which allowed Ari to stabilize the identity of the Icelanders as a social group, while looking to the past for a source of social and legal legitimation.

51 Grønlie, ‘Introduction’, p. viii. For instance, the portents following Bishop Gizurr’s death, which appear, for example, in the work Hungrvaka , are not present in Íslendingabók ; see Jón Helgason (ed.), Byskupa sǫgur, vol. 1 (Copenhagen, 1938), p. 91. It should also be noted that Þorsteinn surtr’s dream, which is described in chapter four of Íslendingabók in connection with a reform of the Old Icelandic calendar, may be seen as a kind of miracle. However, it has nothing to do with metaphysical matters, but with maintaining the order of daily life and society. 52 Grønlie, ‘Introduction’, xxii.

ÍSLENDINGABÓK AS NARRATIVE HISTORY

Thus, Ari’s work can be regarded as a unique history of early Iceland, though one with a strongly narrative flavour, or perhaps even ‘a literary project concerned with history’. 53 At the same time, it clearly conveys sig - nificant information about the time in which it was composed, which has often been overlooked within modern and contemporary scholarly discus - sions about early Icelandic history and culture. The same applies to popular, contemporary attitudes towards the Icelandic Middle Ages, which have also relied more on the work as a historical text of the period it describes, rather than that during which it was written. For example, Einar Jónsson’s statue of Ingólfr Arnarson dominates Arnarhóll, a hill in downtown Reykjavík. Yet, one may wonder why it is Ingólfr and not Ari himself standing at the top of the hill, or why the two figures are not situated side by side? Nevertheless, its pres - ence demonstrates the lasting impact of Ari’s historiography in Iceland today, which is supported by the fact that national celebrations are often held on Arnarhóll. For example, in 2015 Icelanders gathered there to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the election of the world’s first female president, the Icelander Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, and in 2016 the same place was chosen to watch the Icelandic men’s football team’s unprecedented World Cup achievements. The historical significance of the hill is, of course, linked to the fact that it offers a practical location for the gathering of thousands of people. The lasting impact of Ari’s and other early Icelandic historiography in Iceland today is also evi - denced by the presence of museums dedicated to the Settlement and important settlers as they are depicted in the same texts. For instance, Íslendingabók features prominently in a permanent exhibition called 871 ± 2: The Settlement Exhibition , which opened in 2006, after the remains of a tenth-century hall were found just below street level in downtown Reykjavík in 2001. Thus, it is to be expected that Ari’s legacy and medieval accounts of culture and history in Iceland more generally will continue to reverberate in many forms.
