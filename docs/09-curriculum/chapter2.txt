Chapter 2 Units, Dimensional Analysis, and Estimation
But we must not forget that all things in the world are connected with one
another and depend on one another, and that we ourselves and all our thoughts
are also a part of nature. It is utterly beyond our power to measure the changes
of things by time. Quite the contrary, time is an abstraction, at which we arrive
by means of the change of things; made because we are not restricted to any one
definite measure, all being interconnected. A motion is termed uniform in which
equal increments of space described correspond to equal increments of space
described by some motion with which we form a comparison, as the rotation of
the earth. A motion may, with respect to another motion, be uniform. But the
question whether a motion is in itself uniform, is senseless. With just as little
justice, also, may we speak of an “absolute time” --- of a time independent of
change. This absolute time can be measured by comparison with no motion; it
has therefore neither a practical nor a scientific value; and no one is justified in
saying that he knows aught about it. It is an idle metaphysical conception.1
Ernst Mach

2.1 International System of Units
The system of units most commonly used throughout science and technology today is
the Système International (SI). The seven base quantities and their corresponding base
units, are shown in Table 2.1.

Many physical quantities are then derived from the base quantities by a set of algebraic
relations defining the physical relation between these quantities. Mechanics is based on
just the first three of these quantities, the second, the meter, and the kilogram, MKS or

meter-kilogram-second system. An alternative metric system, still widely used, is the
CGS system (centimeter-gram-second).
Example: Derived units for velocity, acceleration, force, energy, and power
Velocity is defined to be the rate of change of position with respect to time and
therefore has the derived SI unit m ⋅s−1 . Acceleration is defined to be the rate of
velocity with respect to time and therefore has the derived SI unit m ⋅s −2 . The newton,
symbol N , is the derived SI unit for force which is equal to the product of mass with
acceleration. Therefore force has the derived SI unit kg ⋅ m ⋅s −2 . The joule, symbol J , is
the derived SI unit for energy which is equal to the product of force with distance.
Therefore the derived SI unit for energy is kg ⋅ m 2 ⋅s−2 . The watt, symbol W , is the
derived SI unit for power which is equal to the rate of change of energy with respect to
time. Therefore the derived SI unit for power is kg ⋅ m 2 ⋅s−3 .
The base quantities were originally determined by experiment with uncertainties in their
values. Gradually the base units were no longer defined by physical prototypes like the
standard kilogram or standard meter bar but were defined by asset of constants. As of
May 20, 2019, all the base SI units are now defined in terms of seven constants shown
in Table 2.2.

The International Committee for Weights and Measures describes practical methods
(mises en practique) for “realizing” a unit”.2 This means a method for the
establishment of the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as
the unit that is consistent with the definition of the unit. Any method that is traceable to
the seven constants could be used.
The future definition of a unit does not imply any particular experiment for its practical
realization. Any method capable of deriving an amount of base quantity value traceable
to the set of seven reference constants could, in principle, be used. A primary method
for realizing each unit is one that achieves the best precision and lowest uncertainty.
In what follows, the exact language for the definitions of the constants and SI base units
is used. The definitions specify the exact numerical value of each constant when its
value is expressed in the corresponding SI unit. By fixing the exact numerical value the
unit becomes defined, since the product of the numerical value and the unit has to
equal the value of the constant, which is postulated to be invariant. The seven constants
are chosen in such a way that any unit of the SI can be written either through a defining
constant itself or through products or quotients of defining constants.3
2.1.1 Definition of the second
Isaac Newton, in the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (“Mathematical
Principles of Natural Philosophy”), distinguished between time as duration and an
absolute concept of time,
“Absolute true and mathematical time, of itself and from its own nature,
flows equably without relation to anything external, and by another
name is called duration: relative, apparent, and common time, is some
sensible and external (whether accurate or unequable) measure of
duration by means of motion, which is commonly used instead of true
time; such as an hour, a day, a month, a year. ”4.
Before 1960, the second was defined as the fraction 1/ 86400 of the mean solar
day, which varied due to slight changes in the earth rotation and so this was not a good
definition. The development of clocks based on atomic oscillations allowed measures of
timing with accuracy on the order of 1 part in 1014 , corresponding to errors of less than
one microsecond (one millionth of a second) per year. Given the incredible accuracy of

this measurement, and clear evidence that the best available timekeepers were atomic in
nature, the second [s] was defined in 1967 by the International Committee on Weights
and Measures as a certain number of cycles of electromagnetic radiation emitted by
cesium (or caesium) atoms as they make transitions between two designated quantum
states:
The second, symbol s , is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical value of the cesium frequency Δν Cs , the unperturbed
ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the cesium 133 atom to
be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz , which is equal to s −1 . 5
The second is equal to the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation
corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels F = 4 and
F = 3 of the ground state 6s1/2 of the cesium 133 atom.

The hyperfine frequency is exactly defined to be

Δν Cs = 9 192 631 770 Hz = 9 192 631 770 s −1

A primary method to “realize” a second, the unit of time, with the highest accuracy
involves certain national metrology laboratories that design primary frequency
standards. The primary frequency standards aim at exactly realizing the SI second using
the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133
atom, and for which corrections with respect to all known systematic shifts due to a
variety of physical phenomena (gravitation is especially problematic in correcting for its
effect) have been applied to best knowledge. The accuracy order of the best primary
frequency standards that define the SI second approaches 1 part in 1016 .
The invention of the optical frequency comb made it possible to increase the “tic rate”
of an atomic clock by a factor of one thousand or more, opening the way to replacing
the cesium frequency standard by an optical frequency standard with uncertainty at the
level of 1 part in 1018 , using an atom such as strontium or ytterbium, or an ion such as
ytterbium or aluminum. 6
2.1.2 Definition of the meter
The meter was originally defined as 1/10,000,000 of the arc from the Equator to the
North Pole along the meridian passing through Paris. In 1889 the meter was redefined
in terms of the international prototype meter by the 1st Conférence Générale des Poids
et Mèsures (CGPM). The prototype meter was a platinum bar with an etched length
scale to aid in calibration and ease of comparison, preserved near Paris. The accuracy of
the bar was limited to one part in 107 . Effects of temperature and pressure needed to be
precisely calibrated as well as the mounting in order to ensure that the bar was straight.
In 1960 the CGPM introduced a microscopic reference by defining the meter as the
length equal to 1650763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to
the transition between the levels 2p10 and 5d 5 of the krypton 86 atom. This definition
of the meter depended on a particular radiation and cannot be realized to better than 4
parts in 109 .

In 1983 the 17th CGPM defined the speed of light as a constant and the meter was
redefined in terms of the distance that light traveled in 1/ 299 792 458 of a second.
The meter, symbol m , is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the
fixed numerical speed of light in vacuum c to be 299 792 458 when
expressed in the unit m ⋅s−1 , where the second is defined in terms of the
cesium frequency Δν Cs . 7

The meter is therefore defined by

This new definition, opens the way to major improvements in the precision with which
the meter can be realized using laser wavelength and frequency measurement
techniques. It is worth noting that the new definition has only become practicable with
the development of techniques for the measurement of frequencies of electromagnetic
radiations in the visible and near infrared. These can now be measured directly in terms
of the frequency of the cesium standard which is used in the definition of the second.”8

5d 5 of the 86 Kr is equal to f = 494886516.5 MHz . Using the definition of the speed of

transition, (ii) How does this frequency compare to the frequency derived from the

2.1.3 Definition of the kilogram
The kilogram was the last base unit in the International System of Units (SI) that
was replaced in Nov 18, 2018 by a new definition in terms of the constants. The old
kilogram was a physical artifact, known as the “International Prototype of the Standard
