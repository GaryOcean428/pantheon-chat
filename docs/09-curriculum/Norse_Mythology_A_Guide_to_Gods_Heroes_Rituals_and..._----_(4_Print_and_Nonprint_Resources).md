For the Viking Age a number of excellent works exist offering varying treatments: Else Roesdahl,

, trans. Susan M. Margeson and Kirsten Williams (New York and London: Penguin The Vikings

Books, 1992; Danish original 1987), presents a general survey. Roesdahl is an archaeologist, but she

is well informed on the written sources as well, and she offers the most accessible and complete

treatment currently available. Peter Sawyer, ed. , The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings

(Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), contains a collection of chapters by various

experts on a number of subjects, based on the latest research. Numerous illustrations enhance the

work. R. I. Page, (Toronto and Buffalo: Chronicles of the Vikings: Records, Memorials, and Myths

University of Toronto Press, 1995) offers a collection of primary source materials with introductions

and commentaries. John Haywood, (New York and The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings

London: Penguin Books, 1995), is a wonderful collection of maps and includes illustrations in color

and apt commentary.

Of the many older works on the Viking Age, none is encountered more frequently than Gwyn

Jones, , rev. ed. (New York and London: Oxford University Press, 1984). It A History of the Vikings

is engaging if a bit wordy. Peter Foote and David M. Wilson, The Achievement of the Vikings: The

(London: Sidgwick and Jackson, 1970), is Society and Culture of Early Medieval Scandinavia

unsurpassed in the detail of its expert coverage. A groundbreaking work was that of Peter Sawyer,

, 2nd ed. (London: E. Arnold, 1971). David Wilson, The Age of the Vikings The Vikings and Their

(New York: McGraw Hill, 1970), is for the general Origins: Scandinavia in the First Millennium

reader. Johannes Brøndsted, (New York: Penguin, 1965; Danish original 1960), now The Vikings

seems outmoded.

Larger-format illustrated books include James Graham-Campbell and Dafydd Kidd, The Vikings

(New York: W. Morrow and Co., 1980), the catalog of an exhibition held at the British Museum and

the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Published the same year were two similar books: James Graham-

Campbell et al., (New Haven and New York: Ticknor and Fields, 1980), and The Viking World

David M. Wilson, ed., The Northern World: The History and Heritage of Northern Europe AD 400–

(New York: H. N. Abrams, 1980), both perhaps inspired by the exhibition. They all follow in 1100

the path of Bertil Almgren et al., eds., (Gothenburg, Sweden: Tre Tryckare, 1967), in The Viking

including chapters by various experts and rich illustrations, many in color, on large pages. And an

explicit exhibition catalog is William Fitzhugh and Elisabeth I. Ward, Vikings: The Norse Atlantic

(Washington, DC, and London: Smithsonian Institution Press, 2000). It focuses on the Viking Saga

expansion west across the Atlantic and is particularly authoritative on the subjects that are best

informed by archaeology. A separate chapter is devoted to religion, art, and runes.

Medieval Scandinavia has attracted far less general attention than the Viking Age. An exception

is Peter Sawyer and Bibi Sawyer, Medieval Scandinavia: From Conversion to Reformation, circa

, Nordic Series, 17 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993). Otherwise one 800–1500

This is a field in which things are moving rapidly. As a result, Haakon Shetelig and Hjalmar Falk,

Etymology

The standard etymological dictionary is Jan de Vries, Altnordisches etymologisches Wörterbuch

(Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1962). Alexander Jóhannesson’s (Bern: Isländisches etymologisches Wörterbuch

Francke, [1951–1956]) is also valuable, but access to entries is through Indo-European roots, so it is

not for the uninitiated. Those who cannot read German are referred to Gabriel Turville-Petre’s Myth

(New York: Holt, Rinehart, and and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia

Winston, 1964; reprint, Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1975)—though it is long out of print—

which usually includes information of an etymological nature, as do Rudolf Simek, Lexikon der

, translated as , trans. Angela Hall altgermanischen Mythologie Dictionary of Northern Mythology

(Cambridge, England, and Rochester, NY: D. S. Brewer, 1993), and Andy Orchard, Dictionary of

(London: Cassell, 1997). Another resource is the Norse Myth and Legend American Heritage

, which contains a glossary of Indo-European roots that is Dictionary of the English Language

interesting to consult in connection with an etymological discussion involving such roots.

Although there are good introductory works on the study of place-names in the Scandinavian

languages, they and nearly all the specialist literature are unavailable in English. Those interested in

the use of the gods’ names in place-names can, however, easily study the maps in de Vries’s

, Grundriss der germanischen Philologie, 12:1–2 (Berlin: W. de Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte

Gruyter, 1956–1957), if they have a German-English dictionary at hand.

Students wishing to learn more about the history of the Germanic languages in general should

turn to Orrin W. Robinson, Old English and Its Closest Relatives: A Survey of the Earliest Germanic

(Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1992), and Hans Frede Nielsen, Languages The Germanic

(Tuscaloosa and London: University of Languages: Origins and Early Dialectal Interrelations

Alabama Press, 1989). For Scandinavian, turn to Einar Haugen, The Scandinavian Languages: An

THE CONVERSION OF ICELAND

Dag Strömbäck, , trans. and annotated by Peter Foote, Viking Society for The Conversion of Iceland

Northern Research, Text Series, 6 (London: Viking Society for Northern Research, 1975), is a model

of scholarship, and one need look no further, although more complete treatment, and especially an

analysis of the central events at the althingi in 1000 ., may be found in Jón Hnefill Aðalsteinsson, C.E

and Wiksell, 1978). Those deeply pressed for time, those who prefer their history in a popularized

form, or those who like pictures could turn to the very short work of Michael Scott Rohan and Allan

J. Scott, (Oxford: Alder Publishing, 1980), which presupposes no prior The Hammer and the Cross

knowledge.

MEDIEVAL ICELAND

Since virtually all the texts of Scandinavian mythology were recorded in medieval Iceland, a

knowledge of that society will be helpful. I recommend Jón Jóhannesson, A History of the Old

(cited above), for the historical background up through Icelandic Commonwealth: Íslendinga saga

the thirteenth century. For an excellent anthropological analysis of the Icelandic commonwealth, see

first Kirsten Hastrup, Culture and History in Medieval Iceland: An Anthropological Assessment of

e (Oxford: Clarendon, 1985); this work also includes direct commentary on the Structure and Chang

mythology, especially as regards cosmology. Hastrup’s Island of Anthropology: Studies in Past and

, Viking Collection, 5 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1990), contains other Present Iceland

relevant essays by Hastrup, and a collection of essays is to be found in Gísli Pálsson, ed., From

(Enfield Lock, England: Hisarlik Sagas to Society: Contemporary Approaches to Early Iceland

Press, 1992). Books that focus on the interface between history and literature are Preben

Meulengracht Sørensen, , trans. John Saga and Society: An Introduction to Old Norse Literature

Tucker, Studia Borealis/Nordic Studies, 1 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1993; Danish original

1977), and, in the two essays of its introduction, Theodore M. Andersson and William Ian Miller,

(Stanford: Stanford Law and Literature in Medieval Iceland: Ljósvetninga saga and Valla-Ljóts saga

University Press, 1989). Miller’s Bloodtaking and Peacemaking: Feud, Law, and Society in Saga

(Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1990), is a detailed and thorough Iceland

analysis of the processes of dispute resolution as they are manifested in the sagas; these processes are

in my view directly relevant to the mythology. Students may also find useful Jesse Byock, Feud in

(Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982), and Byock, the Icelandic Saga

(Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1988). Medieval Iceland

WOMEN AND GENDER

The role of women in society and literature has been the subject of several recent investigations. See

Judith Jesch, (Woodridge, England: Boydell, 1991); Jenny Jochens, Women in the Viking Age

(Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1995), and Jochens, Women in Old Norse Society Old Norse

(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996). Carol J. Clover argues that Images of Women

gender is less important than power in “Regardless of Sex: Men, Women, and Power in Early

Northern Europe,” 68 (1993): 363–387. Speculum

ENCYCLOPEDIAS

Several encyclopedias offer easy access to relevant information on Norse mythology. Philip

Pulsiano, Kirsten Wolf, Paul Acker, and Donald K. Fry, , Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia

Garland Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages, 1; Garland Reference Library of the Humanities, 934

(New York and London: Garland Publishing, 1993), offers articles on literary, historical, and

archaeological subjects. It supplements the 22-volume Nordic compilation, published in all five

Nordic countries, entitled in Swedish Kulturhistoriskt lexikon för nordisk medeltid från vikingatid till

(Malmö, Sweden: Allhems förlag, 1956–1978); the articles are in the Scandinavian reformationstid

languages, but the references may be helpful even to those who cannot read those languages. The

, Joseph R. Strayer, general editor, 13 vols. (New York: Scribners, Dictionary of the Middle Ages

1982–1989), has extensive coverage of Scandinavia, including articles on Norse mythology.

Similarly, , Mircea Eliade, editor-in-chief, 16 vols. (New York and The Encyclopedia of Religion

London: Macmillan, 1987), contains articles on Indo-European, Germanic, and Scandinavian myth

and religion. Those who can read German will find profit in consulting the articles in the new edition

of the , ed. Heinrich Beck et al. (Berlin and New Reallexikon der germanischen Altertumskunde

York: W. de Gruyter, 1973–), many of which are detailed studies of myths and religious topics in

their own right. The , 9 vols. (Munich and Zurich: Artemis Verlag, 1980– Lexikon des Mittelalters

1998), has good articles on medieval history and literature. Scandinavian medieval literature and

mythology are also treated in Carl Lindahl, John McNamara, and John Lindow, eds., Medieval

, 2 vols. (Santa Barbara, Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs

CA: ABC-CLIO, 2000).

PRIMARY SOURCES—TRANSLATIONS

Although several attempts have been made to translate the , none has been fully Poetic Edda

successfully, primarily because of the difficulty of the texts themselves in several places. Henry

Adams Bellows, The Poetic Edda: Translated from the Icelandic with an Introduction and Notes

(New York: American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1923), is still serviceable, although it employs

some idiosyncratic spellings (e.g., for ), and the copious footnotes are to be Hovamol Hávamál

avoided. Lee M. Hollander, The Poetic Edda: Translated with an Introduction and Explanatory Notes

, 2nd ed., rev. (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1962), uses an archaic English that is not without

interest but usually baffles the ordinary reader. Paul B. Taylor and W. H. Auden, The Elder Edda: A

(New York: Random House, 1967–1969), is the result of a collaboration between a scholar Selection

and a distinguished poet, but its arrangement of the poems is arbitrary, and other translations are

more literally accurate. Patricia Terry, (Indianapolis, IN: Poems of the Vikings: The Elder Edda

Bobbs-Merrill [1969]), also suffers from lapses in accuracy. The most recent translation into English,

useful and accessible, is that of Carolyne Larrington, The Poetic Edda: Translated with an

(Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996). Ursula Dronke is Introduction and Notes

producing an edition of eddic poems; in addition to introductions and notes, it contains English

translations facing the Icelandic text. Dronke’s translations are splendid, but the work as a whole is

intended for an academic rather than a general audience. As of this writing, two volumes have

appeared: , vol. 1, The Poetic Edda Heroic Poems: Edited with Translation, Introduction, and

(Oxford: Clarendon, 1969), and , vol. 2, Commentary The Poetic Edda Mythological Poems: Edited

(Oxford: Clarendon, 1997; contains with Translation, Introduction, and Commentary Völuspá,

). Finally, Sigurður Nordal’s famous and influential edition of , with commentary, Hávamál Völuspá

is available in English translation by B. S. Benedikz and John McKinnell, Durham and St. Andrews

Medieval Texts, 1 (Durham, England: Durham and St. Andrews Medieval Texts, 1978).

The most recent English translation of Snorri Sturluson’s is also the best: Anthony Faulkes, Edda

, Everyman Classics, Edda / Snorri Sturluson: Translated from the Icelandic and Introduced

Everyman’s Library, 499 (London: Dent, 1987). A translation of most of the mythological passages

is offered by Jean I. Young, The Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson: Tales from Norse Mythology,

(Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, c. 1954). It is Selected and Translated

accurate, and the introduction by Sigurður Nordal is pleasant, but because it omits most of

and all of , it gives a false impression of the work as a whole, and it is not Skáldskaparmál Háttatal

free from occasional bowdlerization. Arthur Gilchrist Brodeur’s The Prose Edda, by Snorri

, Scandinavian Classics, 5 (New York: Sturluson: Translated from the Icelandic with an Introduction

American-Scandinavian Foundation, 1916), is long out of print but still quite usable.

Some mythological skaldic verses are gathered in Lee M. Hollander, The Skalds: A Selection of

(Princeton: Princeton University Press, for the American- Their Poems, with Introductions and Notes

Scandinavian Foundation, New York, c. 1945); some may also be found translated and explicated in

Gabriel Turville-Petre’s (Oxford: Clarendon, 1976). Other significant verse may be Scaldic Poetry

Finally, Hermann Pálsson and Magnus Magnus Magnusson, The Vinland Sagas: The Norse

before Columbus; in the context of this work, it is relevant because of the elaborate description of a

PRIMARY SOURCES—COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS

Eddic and Skaldic Poetry

Unfortunately, this is perhaps the area in which one is most handicapped by an inability to read

German and the Scandinavian languages. A number of commentaries to eddic poetry have appeared

over the years, but all are in German, even the one announced by a team of scholars at Frankfurt and

manifest in sample texts. The only commentaries, therefore, are those attached to the translations

mentioned above. Dronke’s is the most satisfying, but she has placed fairly severe limits on going

beyond actual textual issues. Larrington’s notes are also sound, but I cannot recommend with any

enthusiasm anything else on the eddic corpus. And the case is all but hopeless for skaldic poetry.

There are, to be sure, the commentaries accompanying Turville-Petre’s and Hollander’s translations,

but the texts presented are very limited. There are also, of course, monographic treatments of various

important skaldic poems, but these texts are so difficult that such treatments tend generally to limit

themselves to comment on language and grammar rather than on content. Those who can read the

Scandinavian languages can make use of the corpora and commentaries created by Finnur Jónsson

The most recent general survey in English is that of Jónas Kristjánsson, Eddas and Sagas: Iceland’s

, trans. Peter Foote (Reykjavík: Hið íslenska bókmenntafélag, 1988). A Medieval Literature

collection of essays summarizing the state of scholarship and including extensive bibliographies for

myth and mythography, eddic poetry, skaldic poetry, kings’ sagas, sagas of Icelanders, and romances

is Carol J. Clover and John Lindow, eds., (cited Old Norse-Icelandic Literature: A Critical Guide

above). The are the most important omission from that collection, but it was fornaldarsögur

somewhat remedied by the publication of Stephen A. Mitchell, (Ithaca, Heroic Sagas and Ballads

NY, and London: Cornell University Press, 1991).

The relationship between the social conditions and the literature is presented in Preben

Meulengracht Sørensen’s excellent (cited Saga and Society: An Introduction to Old Norse Literature

above). Meulengracht Sørensen is particularly good on mythic patterns in the literature in general.

Sigurður Nordal, , trans. and with notes by Vilhjalmur T. Bjarnar (Ithaca, NY: Icelandic Culture

Cornell University Library, 1990) is not, strictly speaking, a literary history, but it offers much that is

of interest. Those who read German may turn to Jan de Vries, , 2 Altnordische Literaturgeschichte

vols., Grundriss der germanischen Philologie, 15–16 (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1964), but all the other

standard literary surveys are in the Scandinavian languages.

MYTHOLOGY: GENERAL TREATMENTS

Scandinavian myth and religion is a field in which much older work is still read and cited, with the

inevitable result that a great percentage of the material is in German and the Scandinavian languages

(there is also much of interest in Italian, French, and Russian, among others). It is possible to get a

sense of the scholarship up to the early 1980s by consulting my Scandinavian Mythology: An

, Garland Folklore Bibliographies, 13 (New York: Garland, 1988). If there is Annotated Bibliography

a standard reference work, it is Jan de Vries, , 2 vols., 2nd ed., Altgermanische Religionsgeschichte

Grundriss der germanischen Philologie, 12–13 (Berlin: W. de Gruyter, 1956–1967). However, there

are many introductory works in English that can be recommended. The best in my view remains that

of Gabriel Turville-Petre, Myth and Religion of the North: The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia

(cited above), but it is long out of print. H. R. Ellis Davidson, Gods and Myths of Northern Europe

(Baltimore: Penguin, 1964), pays less attention to textual detail than I would like but remains in print

and is sound. Davidson also contributed a large-format book originally entitled Scandinavian

(London and New York: Hamlyn, 1969) and recently reissued as Mythology Viking and Norse

(New York: Barnes and Noble, 1996); this work has especially attractive plates of many Mythology

of the more significant artifacts. A very brief treatment, but quite nice, is that of R. I. Page, Norse

(London: British Museum; and Austin: University of Texas Press, 1990). A very long Myths

treatment is the volume in the older series Mythology of All Races by John Arnott MacCulloch (the

editor of the series) entitled simply (New York: M. Jones; reprint, New York: Cooper Square Eddic

Publishers, 1964).

I am not fond of works that in their systematization take readers away from the texts; unlike, say,

Greek mythology, Norse mythology is actually found in such a limited textual corpus that it seems to

me indefensible to part from it. Thus I cannot recommend the work of the Norwegian historian Peter

Andreas Munch, revised by the great philologist Magnus Olsen and available in English as Norse

, trans. Sigure Bernhard Hustvedt (New York: American- Mythology: Legends of Gods and Heroes

Scandinavian Foundation, 1927), although the Norwegian version, with comments added by Anne

Holtsmark, is definitely worth a look. Nor do I recommend Brian Branston, (New Gods of the North

York: Vanguard, n.d. [1955?]), or Kevin Crossley-Holland, The Norse Myths: Introduced and Retold

(New York: Pantheon Books, 1980).

MYTHOLOGY: IMPORTANT STUDIES

The best modern treatment of the mythology, and one to which every serious reader can turn with

profit, is Margaret Clunies Ross, , Prolonged Echoes: Old Norse Myths in Medieval Northern Society

vol. 1, , Viking Collection, 7 (Odense: Odense University Press, 1994), and vol. 2, The Myths The

, Viking Collection, 10 (Odense: Odense University Reception of Norse Myths in Medieval Iceland

Press, 1998). The first volume succeeds admirably in reading the entire mythology as a system in

which the ongoing opposition between the gods and giants is read as a struggle involving social

hierarchies within a complex symbolic system. Clunies Ross knows the scholarship intimately and

has masterful analytic skills; if you read only one book on the mythology (other than the one in your

hands now), make it this one. Volume 2 is of more interest in connection with rest of Old Norse–

Icelandic literature, but it is equally enthralling.

Two other recent A-to-Z treatments of the mythology have preceded this one. The earlier was

that of Rudolf Simek, , cited above; the German original appeared Dictionary of Northern Mythology

in 1984 in a series of small-format encyclopedias and therefore was presumably formed at least in

part to fit the parameters of that series. It is trustworthy and particularly helpful if one is interested in

postmedieval manifestations of the mythology in art, literature, and music, for articles ordinarily end

with information about such manifestations. Since the work was originally intended for German

readers, secondary literature in English is cited only when the author deems it particularly relevant,

and full references are not cited. The second such encyclopedia was that of Andy Orchard,

, cited above. As is the case with Simek, the scholarship is Dictionary of Norse Myth and Legend

wholly sound. Orchard’s book has greater coverage in that it also takes in heroic legend, and the

result is that the mythological entries tend to be somewhat shorter than those in Simek’s volume. The

book also contains not quite 40 illustrations. A particularly nice touch is the set of appendices listing

and offering translations for the numerous names of Odin, dwarfs, giants, and “troll-wives,

giantesses and valkyries.” Bibliographic citations in the body of the texts are to about 850 items

gathered in four lists in the back of the book.

myth and religion may be found in Dumézil, , ed. Einar Haugen, trans. Gods of the Ancient Northmen

NONPRINT RESOURCES

Keying “Norse mythology” into the Google search engine on the world wide web, I got 8,540 hits.

Clearly there is a lot of stuff out there. At , one of the http://www.pan-theon.org/mythica/areas/norse/

first sites I visited, I found an A-to-Z listing of the major and minor figures in Norse mythology

similar to what is found in this book. This listing is part of The Encyclopedia Mythica: An

. Randomly looking at some entries, I found this Encyclopedia on Mythology, Folklore, and Legend

on Bragi:

The god of eloquence and poetry, and the patron of skalds (poets) in Norse mythology. He is

regarded as a son of Odin and Frigg. Runes were carved on his tongue and he inspired poetry

in humans by letting them drink from the mead of poetry. Bragi is married to Idun, the

goddess of eternal youth. Oaths were sworn over the Bragarfull (Cup of Bragi), and drinks

were taken from it in honor of a dead king. Before a king ascended the throne, he drank from

such a cup.

There are no fewer than six errors in this paragraph (the lingual runes being the most

spectacular), and this sad fact leads me to the major point that must be made about materials to be

found on the Internet: . Content is easy to find, but there is no quality Use them at your own risk

control. The Internet is best used to look at things like maps, images (samples of actual Old Norse–

Icelandic manuscripts, for example, may be viewed at ), or the actual text of www.hum.ku.dk/ami

some primary source. (There are many Internet sites offering primary sources, but my comments in

about primary sources apply here, too.) Chapter 4

I know of two sites with bibliographies. , at the The Bibliography of Old Norse-Icelandic Studies

University of Odense Library in Denmark, covers the entire field, not just the mythology. Its English-

language URL is . A very brief bibliography http://www.sdu.dk/oub/fagomraa/nordisk/boniseng.htm

of the compiled at the Fiske Icelandic Collection of the Cornell University Library may Poetic Edda

be found at . http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/Fiske/edda.html

Scott Trimble, a former student in my undergraduate class at the University of California at

Berkeley on Scandinavian mythology, has built the website . The http://www.stst.net/Scandinavian/

genealogy page is a brave attempt to concoct a single genealogy for the entire system. Browsing sites

that sell term papers, I found that one can obtain an eight-page paper titled “The Giant Loki in Norse

Mythology” for $8.95 per page (a few months later the price had risen to $9.95). I didn’t buy it, but

skimming the summary gave me the impression that I may in fact have already read it.

Look about on the Internet. You will find descriptions of the mythology; encyclopedic listings

long and short; student term papers; collections of texts; collections of pictures; close and

imaginative retellings of the myths; fiction; poetry and music; Wiccan sites; neopagan sites of

various kinds, some including on-line shrines; games; rants and ravings; course curricula; children’s

literature; comic books; clubs to join; sites devoted in whatever way to individual gods and

goddesses; a “scavenger hunt” (actually a list of questions apparently used in a unit on the

mythology in some school); a “guest book” to which you can post any comment you like relating,

however tenuously, to Norse mythology; instructions to third-grade teachers doing a unit on Norse

mythology; instructions for integrating the study of Norse mythology into home schooling; science

fiction; astrology. Just exercise care. If it doesn’t look right, it probably isn’t. After all, if I, an expert

in Old Norse–Icelandic mythology, were to devise and print on the Internet plans for a supersonic

jet, would you build and fly it?
