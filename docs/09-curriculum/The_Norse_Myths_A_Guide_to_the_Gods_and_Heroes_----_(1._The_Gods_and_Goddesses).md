THE NORSE DIVINITIES

There are two distinct groups of Norse gods, the majority Æsir and the altogether more mysterious Vanir. Both tribes have male and female members, but although the female Æsir are known as Ásynjur (goddesses), the Vanir don’t seem to have a separate term for their females, perhaps because Freyja is

the only one we know about. is the plural of the noun , meaning ‘god’; when the term is used by Æsir Áss itself as ‘the Áss’, it usually refers to Þórr.

THE ÆSIR

Óðinn, whose name means something like ‘the Furious One’, is the leader of the gods; he is sometimes called the ‘All-father’, but it is not a name that crops up often. He’s a war-god, but unlike Freyr, he’s more of a strategist than a fighter, teaching his chosen heroes effective battle-formations, including one

shaped like a pig’s snout, the . Óðinn stirs up conflict, so that he may see who is worthy to svínfylking

enter his great hall Valhöll (Valhalla), to join the , the warriors who will fight with the gods at Einherjar

. He decrees defeat or victory in battle, and he is able to confer immunity to wounds with his ragnarök spear, although he sometimes sends his valkyries to determine who will win or lose.

Óðinn

Leader of the Æsir. One-eyed, bearded, old. God of wisdom, magic, battle, kingship; worshipped by the elite; chooser of the slain. Attribute: spear called Gungnir. Halls: chiefly Valhöll (Valhalla, Hall of the Slain), but a number of others, including Glaðheimr (Glad- home) and Valaskjálf (Shelf of the Slain) where Hliðskjálf (Opening-shelf), the high seat which lets him look out over the worlds, is situated. Transport: by eight-legged horse Sleipnir, but often travels on foot and in disguise. Animal associations: ravens (Huginn and Muninn, ‘Thought’ and ‘Memory’); wolves (Geri and Freki, ‘Ravener’ and ‘Devourer’). Married to Frigg; numerous liaisons with giantesses and human women. Sons are Þórr, Baldr, Víðarr, Váli, Höðr. Particularly important in Denmark.

One-eyed Óðinn with his ravens and his spear Gungnir, in an eighteenth-century Icelandic manuscript.

Óðinn is also the god of wisdom, and he seeks it out wherever it may be found. He has sacrificed one of his eyes in Mímir’s Well to gain arcane knowledge, and he hanged himself on the World-Tree Yggdrasill in order to win knowledge of the runes, the Germanic writing system which enabled gods and men to record their knowledge for posterity.

Valkyries

Valkyries are supernatural women who dwell in Valhöll. They serve wine and mead to the warriors who live there. Another of their tasks is to ride out to battle, where they bestow victory or defeat, and their name means ‘Choosers of the Slain’. Sometimes Óðinn instructs them as to who is to win, and sometimes they take the initiative in choosing who will accompany them back to Valhöll. Not all kings are thrilled to be invited to join the elite (but dead) warriors, rather than continuing to rule on earth. A memorial poem for the Norwegian King Hákon depicts him as distinctly sulky, even when the greatest heroes of the past welcome him to the hall. The valkyrie Brynhildr is punished by Óðinn for disobeying orders and giving victory to a younger and handsomer man. Some human girls also take up the valkyrie life as shield-maidens. This allows them to choose a heroic husband who can save them from marriage to an unwanted suitor, as we’ll see in . Chapter 4

on that tree of which no man knows

from where its roots run.

With no bread did they refresh me nor a drink from a horn,

downwards I peered;

I took up the runes, screaming I took them,

then I fell back from there. SAYINGS OF THE HIGH ONE, VV . 138–39

Óðinn also knows spells to achieve various things: animating the dead, quenching fires, calling up

winds. He lists eighteen of them in (Sayings of the High One), but declines either to give Hávamál details or to reveal the last one, which he won’t tell any woman, unless it’s his lover or his sister – and since there’s no evidence for him having a sister, and he doesn’t necessarily part on good terms with his lovers, that secret may be kept for a very long time indeed.

One of Óðinn’s chief concerns is to find out as much as he can about , the end of the world. ragnarök

To this end he visits various people in the divine and human worlds (see and ). He knows Chapters 5 6

that the death of his son Baldr is one of the most significant portents of the end, but he hopes that – somehow – he can find a way of falsifying the prophecies about the catastrophe to come. He is also an

accomplished practitioner of magic of a particularly disreputable kind called (see , seiðr Chapter 2 page

). We don’t know much about what this entails, but it seems mainly to be the province of women. 84

When men perform it, it involves cross-dressing: something that is inherently shameful in Norse culture.

In fact, Óðinn and Loki have an exchange of words about it in the poem (Loki’s Quarrel). Lokasenna When Óðinn accuses Loki of spending eight winters under the earth in the form of a milch-cow and a

woman, bearing children there, Loki retorts that his blood-brother practised on the island of seiðr Sámsey (modern Samsø, lying between Sweden and Denmark) ‘and beat on the drum as seeresses do’. Frigg quickly intervenes to tell the two gods not to discuss such mysterious, ancient matters in public.

Óðinn is also the patron of kings. We’ll see in how he takes an interest in human kings and Chapter 4

heroes. He’s keen to get his favourites onto the throne, and he also wants them to rule effectively. Yet, in line with his task of choosing the best heroes for Valhöll, he also oversees the death of kings and heroes, a role which they often regard as a betrayal. In some poems they reproach Óðinn when they arrive in Valhöll, claiming, correctly, that he is not to be trusted.

Runes

The runes are the Germanic writing system, which pre-dated the introduction of the Roman alphabet to the north with the coming of Christianity. The runes evolved at the very beginning of the first century , CE probably out of a version of the Roman alphabet, and perhaps in the Rhine area. The letters were adapted to be easy to carve on hard surfaces such as wood or stone. The older (as the alphabet is called, futhark after its first six letters) comprised twenty-four or twenty-five letters. Later the alphabet was simplified as the younger in the late eighth century in Scandinavia. This contained only sixteen characters and futhark the majority of surviving runic inscriptions use it. The runes represented a sound, such as ‘b’ or ‘th’, but each rune also had a name: ‘f’ was (money, property) for example. In Old Norse myth the runes have fé

magical properties – Óðinn uses them to bewitch the princess Rindr (see ). In the sagas there are Chapter 6

cases of sick people getting worse because wrongly cut runes have been used to try to heal them.

Þórr as thunder god, riding out in his goat-drawn chariot to smite giants with his hammer. Painting by Mårten Eskil

Winge (1872).

Þórr’s chief role is to defend the gods’ realm against the depredations of giants. He spends much of his time journeying in the east, where he wages war with his mighty hammer Mjöllnir on giants and giantesses alike. He is the one god who forges a close relationship with humans; he has two servants, a boy and a girl, called Þjálfi and Röskva. Although Loki’s giant affiliations should make Þórr highly

suspicious of him, the two gods often adventure together. Þórr’s opponent at is the Miðgarðs- ragnarök serpent, a child of Loki, who will rise out of the sea.

is inevitable, Þórr too has an early face-off with the Miðgarðs-serpent (see for the ragnarök Chapter 3

full story).

Þórr

Red-bearded, batterer of giants. Short-tempered and not especially clever. God of weather, of sea-faring (in Iceland), of the fields and crops; worshipped by farmers. Attributes: hammer Mjöllnir; a pair of iron gloves; the belt of divine power. Halls: Þrúðheimr (Vigour-home); Bilskírnir (with 540 doors). Transport: goat-drawn chariot. Animal associations: the goats Tanngnjóstr and Tanngrisnir (Tooth-gnasher; Tooth-grinder). These animals can be killed, eaten, and reconstituted the next morning. Married to Sif, the golden-haired; son of Jörð (Earth, a giantess), and Óðinn. Children: Magni and Móði and daughter Þrúðr. In one poem Þórr returns home to find his daughter betrothed to a hideous dwarf; the god tests the dwarf Alvíss (All-wise) in arcane lore until the sun comes up and he’s turned to stone. Most important god in Norway and Iceland.

Not very much is known about Heimdallr. He is the divine watchman, keeping an eye open for the

approach of enemies. He will blow his mighty horn at the onset of . His hearing is – ragnarök mysteriously – sunk in Mímir’s Well, like Óðinn’s eye, but this does not damage his capacity to keep watch, for his hearing is so keen that he can hear wool grow on a sheep’s back. He’s also responsible for

establishing the social hierarchy among humans. The poem (Rígr’s List) tells how, assuming Rígsþula the name Rígr (an Irish word for ‘king’), Heimdallr goes walking through the human world. He comes to three houses in turn: one is a peasant hut, one a pleasant farmstead and one a noble hall. At each place, he is invited in, offered food and, for three nights, he sleeps between the married couple in their bed. Each woman later gives birth to a child. The peasant couple’s baby is Thrall, ugly, but brawny, and destined for manual labour. The farming couple’s son is Karl, a well-to-do yeoman who works the land he owns, while the noble pair bring up Jarl, or Earl, a splendid young aristocrat. Jarl’s youngest child is

Konr , ‘young Konr’, a phrase meaning ‘king’ ( ). When Konr is of age, Rígr comes to teach ungr konungr him knowledge of runes. The poem breaks off as Konr is setting out to acquire a kingdom through battle.

Heimdallr with the Gjallar-horn, which he will blow to signal the coming of . From an eighteenth-century ragnarök

Icelandic manuscript.

Heimdallr

Known as the white god; has golden teeth. Watchman of the gods who sits at the edge of the gods’ domain. His back is always dirty from the mud cascading down Yggdrasill. Hearing is hidden in Mímir’s Well at foot of Yggdrasill.

Attribute: the great Gjallar-horn, blown at the onset of . ragnarök Hall: Himinbjörg (Heaven-refuge). Animal association: the horse Gulltoppr (Golden-forelock). Son of nine mothers, all sisters.

Loki puts the mistletoe dart into blind Höðr’s hand (Chapter 6). Elmer Boyd Smith (1902).

Baldr

Best and brightest of the gods; radiates light. Has remarkably blond eyelashes.

Dies young. Will return after ragnarök. Hall: Breiðablikr (Broad-view). Married to Nanna, who goes to Hel with him.

Baldr has little to do in Norse myth, except to die; the story of his murder is related in . Of Chapter 6

all the gods, he is the one who has the strongest kinship ties and when, before his death, he begins to have bad dreams, both his parents spring into action. He is accidentally slain by his brother, while his wife dies of grief at his funeral. It’s foretold that he will come back to the dwellings of the gods after

Occupying a strange and ambivalent position, Loki has mixed parentage which makes his loyalties uncertain. He is Óðinn’s blood-brother, and the highest god has sworn never to drink ale unless Loki is also offered a drink. Loki is always getting the gods into trouble, and thus often has to get them out

again. His luck runs out when, through his boasting in the poem , his role in the death of Loki’s Quarrel

Baldr becomes clear, and he is captured and bound until . On that day he will declare his final ragnarök allegiance to the giants and march with them against the gods. Loki’s mother seems to be a goddess and his father a giant, a match which runs contrary to normal divine marriage rules. His relationship with a giantess brings forth monstrous offspring. His gender is also subject to slippage: he’s the mother of the

eight-legged horse, Sleipnir (see ); he becomes pregnant from eating a half-cooked female Chapter 3

heart; and, as Óðinn claims, he seems to have spent eight winters underground as a woman.

Loki and his invention, the fishing-net, from an eighteenth-century Icelandic manuscript. A net such as this brings about

Loki’s capture (Chapter 6).

Loki

Son of a goddess and a giant. Good-looking but nasty in temperament, and variable in behaviour. Exceptionally cunning, while his sexuality is distinctly polymorphous.

Married to Sigyn. Has two sons. Snorri names them as Váli and Nari or Narfi; the calls them Poetic Edda Nari and Narfi. Father of these cosmic monsters by the giantess Angrboða: Fenrir the Mighty Wolf; the

Miðgarðs-serpent; and Hel, goddess of death. Also the mother (see ) of Sleipnir, Óðinn’s eight- Chapter 3

legged horse.

THE VANIR

The Vanir are an important subgroup of gods. How they came to be among the Æsir is explained in

. There are four named Vanir: Njörðr and his two children Freyr and Freyja, who live in Chapter 2

Ásgarðr, the realm of the gods, and Kvasir, the wisest of gods, who has a very chequered fate (see

). Chapter 3

Njörðr releasing the winds, from a seventeenth-century Icelandic manuscript.

Njörðr

One of the Vanir. God of the sea. Has oversight of fishermen and sea-journeys and hunting. Can quieten winds. Attributes: exceptionally clean feet. Not fond of the mountains. Hall: Nóatún (Ship-yard), by the seashore. Married to the giantess Skaði for a while. Father of Freyr and Freyja, allegedly by his sister.

Njörðr’s chief claim to fame is his unsuccessful marriage to the giantess Skaði (see ). The Chapter 3

earlier incestuous relationship with his sister, on whom he fathered Freyr and Freyja, seems to be permitted among the Vanir; certainly his daughter is accused of having had sex with her brother, along with a good many other men. Njörðr shares the root of his name with Nerthus, a very ancient Germanic female deity mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus, writing in 98 . Njörðr has clearly undergone a CE

sex-change on his journey northwards, but the details of the Nerthus-cult match some of the archaeological evidence for the worship of wooden figures in the later Scandinavian Iron Age.

Nerthus, an Early Germanic Deity

Nerthus, so Tacitus tells us, was the Mother Earth goddess of the Langobardi, a Germanic tribe who lived in northern Italy. Nerthus lived in a sacred grove on an island in a lake. On the island was a holy chariot which only the priest of Nerthus was allowed to touch. Around the chariot was a curtain, and on occasion the goddess would manifest herself behind it. At such times, the priest would lead the chariot, yoked to cows, among the people so that the goddess could visit them. No war or fighting was permitted while the goddess was on her travels; peace and happiness broke out. When the goddess’s journey was over, chariot and cows, and perhaps the goddess herself, were washed by slaves in the sacred lake. Then the slaves were drowned in the same lake, ‘a place of mysterious horror’, Tacitus writes.

Nerthus is borne by her priests among the people. Emil Doepler (1905).

Freyr with his boar, Gullinbursti (Golden-bristle). Johannes Gehrts (1901).

Freyr

One of the Vanir. Handsome. Mentioned as a war-leader, but in Sweden he is chiefly in charge of crops, weather and harvests.

Attributes: gave away his sword and must fight with a deer antler at . ragnarök Hall: Álfheimr (Elf-home). Transport: a fold-up boat, manufactured by dwarfs, called Skíðblaðnir. Animal association: the boar Gullinbursti (Golden-bristle). Married (or had a relationship with) Gerðr, a giantess. Son called Fjölnir. Possible sexual relationship with sister Freyja. Ancestor of the kings of Sweden.

Freyja, the beautiful golden-haired goddess of love. John Bauer (1911).

Freyja

One of the Vanir. Good to invoke in affairs of the heart, and very fond of love-songs. Chooses half the slain, along with Óðinn.

Attributes: falcon-feather flying-cloak. Weeps tears of gold. Owns the neck-ring. Brisinga men Halls: Folkvangr (People-plain) and Søkkvabekkir (Sunken-benches). Transport: chariot drawn by cats. Married to Óðr, who has gone away on a journey, but has apparently slept with almost everyone, including her brother.

Freyr’s name means simply ‘Lord’ and he has two roles. One, less often mentioned, is as a battle-

leader, apparently a more hands-on fighter than Óðinn the tactician. He’s called ‘the gods’ war-leader’ and a ‘bold rider’ who redeems captives from their chains. His other role is as the god of fertility of beast and field. As ancestor of the kings of Sweden he brought good harvests and people sacrificed to

him for prosperity. The story of his courtship of the giantess Gerðr (see ) has often been Chapter 3

thought to reflect the action of the sun-god on the earth in springtime. He also possesses a boar called Gullinbursti (Golden-bristle), capable of being ridden. Freyja, whose name means ‘Lady’, is the goddess most closely associated with sexuality, though she also has some kind of authority over the dead. Her husband Óðr has gone off on a long journey and Freyja weeps tears of gold in his absence. Loki accuses her of having had sex with her brother – but then, as a fertility goddess associated with love-affairs, Freyja seems to have had sex with every-one: ‘of

the Æsir and the elves who are in here / each one has been your lover’, claims Loki. And when the gods caught her in the act with Freyr, she was so alarmed that she farted! She is also a patron of humans and

helps her protégé Óttarr to gain his inheritance, by questioning the giantess Hyndla (see ). Chapter 3

Freyja’s fondness for jewelry is evidenced by the price she was prepared to pay for the wonderful

neck-ring (see ). She is so pleased with her new treasure that she even wears it Brisinga men pages 73–74

to bed. Freyja is said by Snorri to have two daughters, whose names are Gersemi and Hnoss. Both are words for ‘treasure’, cementing the goddess’s association with gold.

LESS IMPORTANT ÆSIR

Týr, the one-handed god, gives victory in battle. He lost his hand in the jaws of the great wolf, Fenrir;

how this came about is told in . He is associated with law and justice and, meanly, Loki twits Chapter 3

him on his lack of even-handedness in this respect. Little more is known about him. His mother is apparently one of the Ásynjur, yet married to a rather unfriendly giant. Týr’s name connects him with both Zeus and Jupiter (they come from the same root), and perhaps he was originally a sky-god. In his Old English form, Tiw, he gives his name to Tuesday.

Týr, watched by Óðinn, places his hand in the mouth of Fenrir, as the fetter tightens around the wolf’s paws. From an

eighteenth-century Icelandic manuscript.

Víðarr, the ‘silent god’, attacks Fenrir (Chapter 6). W. G. Collingwood (1908).

Höðr, the blind god, is the brother of Baldr. The gods prefer not to talk about him, it’s said, because of his role in his brother’s death. He will be killed by Váli in vengeance for Baldr’s slaying. Höðr too will

return in the glorious days after , when ‘all harms will be healed’, and he will then live in peace ragnarök with his brother.

Víðarr is known as the silent god and has thick-soled shoes. He will need these at when he ragnarök will have to avenge his father Óðinn by leaping into the maw of Fenrir the wolf and tearing his jaws apart.

Váli is born to avenge Baldr. How this comes about is narrated in . Chapter 6

Forseti is the go-to god for legal difficulties. He has the best judgment-place at his hall, known as Glitnir (Shining-place). He’s Baldr’s son, and his name is the title now given to the President of Iceland.

Ullr, on skis, with his bow, and perhaps the yew tree from which it was made. From an eighteenth-century Icelandic

manuscript.

Ullr is the god of archery; he is an excellent skier and he’s good to invoke if you’re going to fight in single combat. He lives in Ýdalir (Yew-dales), fittingly, for yew-wood is excellent material for bow- making. He is the son of Sif, and thus the stepson of Þórr, but no one knows who his father is. Finally, there is Bragi, who is the god of poetry, eloquence and language and is married to Iðunn. Bragi was, most likely, originally a human; one of the earliest named poets in Old Norse was called Bragi the Old, and some of his poems have been preserved. He seems to have been a late addition to the pantheon.

THE ÁSYNJUR (GODDESSES)

Frigg, Óðinn’s wife, knows all about fate, even if she does not reveal her knowledge publicly. That her hall is called Fensalir (Fen-halls) suggests that she has an affinity with standing water, and it’s possible that some of the early Iron Age sacrifices made by depositing precious objects in Danish bogs may have

been intended to honour her. Frigg’s Old English counterpart gives her name to Friday in English; Fricg Freyja is not known outside Scandinavia and so it is Fricg who has strong associations with sex in Anglo- Saxon England.

Sif is married to Þórr and had exceptionally beautiful golden hair. This was stolen by Loki – how is unclear, but he insinuates that he has slept with her, and that may have offered the opportunity for his theft. Sif wept for the loss of her locks, but Loki made amends with a dwarf-made substitute set of tresses. This wig grafted itself instantly onto Sif’s head and was even lovelier than the original. ‘Sif’s hair’ is thus a kenning for gold. Iðunn, married to Bragi, is the guardian of the apples of eternal youth. The gods need to eat these regularly if they are to remain young and vigorous. When she and her apples are kidnapped by a

scheming giant (see ), the gods quickly fade and grow old. It’s a situation which, as usual, Loki Chapter 3

is responsible for creating and which he has to remedy through his habitual ingenuity. Gefjun visited King Gylfi of Sweden in the guise of a wandering woman, and, as ‘a reward for his entertainment’, Gylfi agreed to let her have some land – as much as four oxen could plough in a day and a night. This might have constituted a decent-sized farm, but in fact Gefjun had four giant sons. They were transformed into oxen and managed, in their twenty-four-hour ploughing marathon, to carve out a huge hole in Gylfi’s territory. The hole is now Sweden’s third largest lake, Lake Mälaren, and the land that they dragged away has formed the Danish island of Sjælland, where Copenhagen now stands. Gefjun, Snorri tells us, is a virgin and the patron of virgins, which doesn’t exactly square with the giant- son tale. Like Frigg, Gefjun is said to know all about fate.

Frigg

Most important of the goddesses. Patron of love and marriage. Attributes: knows all fate. Also said to have a feather flying-cloak. Hall: Fensalir (Fen-halls). Married to Óðinn, mother of Baldr. Her serving-maid is Fulla.

Gefjun drives the plough with her four giant sons transformed into oxen in order to create the Danish island of Sjælland.

Statue sculpted in 1897–99 by Anders Bundgaard for a fountain in Copenhagen.

Skaði, a giantess and warrior woman, is the goddess of hunting and skiing. Her hall is Þrymheimr (Þrymr’s home – Þrymr is a giant), inherited from her father Þjazi. When Skaði marches, fully armoured and brandishing her weapons, into Ásgarðr, she’s seeking

compensation for the death of Þjazi at the hands of the gods (see ). On that occasion she’s Chapter 3

sweet-talked into accepting a husband from among the gods, with the proviso that she must choose from a range of candidates hidden behind a sheet. Since only their feet are visible, she ends up selecting Njörðr, the god associated with the sea – whose feet are, of course, remarkably bright and clean! Skaði is displeased for she had hoped to win Baldr as husband, but she’s persuaded by Loki that if he can make her laugh, she will accept the situation. Grim-faced Skaði is in no mood for amusement, but Loki ties a goat by the beard to his testicles and each of them pulls in different directions. ‘Both of them screeched very loudly at that,’ Snorri says. Loki tumbles into Skaði’s lap and, finally, she laughs. The sexualized burlesque has done its work, though, as we’ll see, the marriage between Skaði and Njörðr is not a successful one.

Fulla, Frigg’s handmaiden, wears her hair loose and has charge of the goddess’s shoe collection. Fulla is a very old goddess; she appears in a charm in Old High German, recorded in the tenth century.

A Charm Used by the Gods

In the so-called ‘Second Merseburg Charm’, Baldr, Woden, Friia (Frigg) and Volla (Fulla) are mentioned along with some other unidentified figures: Phol, Sinthgut and Sunna. Phol and Woden were riding to the woods when Baldr’s horse sprained its foot. The female deities and Woden conjured the foot to knit together: ‘bone to bone, blood to blood, joint to joint’. The limb was healed and, the spell suggests, the same incantation can be used for curing other creatures. This little story is a mythic memory, invoking the gods’ effective actions to bring about healing in the present.

Frigg and her handmaidens, with Baldr and Óðinn, tend to Baldr’s injured horse. Emil Doepler (1905).

Now that the gods and goddesses have been introduced, it’s time to look at the myths in which they appear. We begin at the very beginning of Time, with the origins of the gods and the creation of the world, in the next chapter.
