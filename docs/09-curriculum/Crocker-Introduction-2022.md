## Introduction
Christopher Crocker and Dustin Geeraert

Here we describe the ‘Asgard’ superphylum, a group of uncultivated archaea that, as well as Lokiarchaeota, includes Thor-, Odin- and Heimdallarchaeota.

The cultural legacies of Old Norse literature, predominantly preserved in Iceland, now appear in a vast array of forms, inspiring scholars and scientists, writers and poets, philosophers and artists of all kinds. Archaeota, ancient life forms which are found only in ocean-floor lava vents, have recently been given names drawn from Old Norse mythology, for example. Likewise, the name of the Old Norse giant who may also be counted as a god, Loki, is now also the name of a perpetually erupting volcano on Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, which displays an unpredictable rhythm: ‘The channel seems to stay open continuously… And yet Loki still changes over time to its own beat’. 2 Examining the complex origins, history, transmission, interpretation, and influence of Old Norse literary works reveals not only preservation, but also transformation. The studies in this collection explore the diverse and rich legacy of Old Norse literature, including its myths, sagas, poems, and histories, from the perspectives of literary criticism, book history and codicology, archaeology, mythology, and folklore, among others. Some studies consider the influence

of Old Norse literature in modern poetry, prose literature, and other creative fields, while others challenge the foundations of established critical perspec - tives on Old Norse literature and its underlying literary culture, offering new critical insights in turn. All share a common concern with both preservation and transformation – the latter being a complex process of challenge, change, adaptation, and continuity. These themes can be found in a remarkable Old Norse myth of transformation, one which envisions an act of divine theft as the ultimate foundation for both poetry and scholarship. A brief account of this myth appears in the eddic poem Hávamál ( Sayings of the High One ) in the form of a boastful confession by the Norse god Óðinn (Odin). The same narrative is also alluded to in a number of kennings found in skaldic poetry. 3 The most complete version, however, occurs within Skáldskaparmál ( Poetic diction ), a handbook for skálds (poets) which is attributed to Snorri Sturluson (1179–1241), the prominent Icelandic chieftain, poet, historian, and mythographer who remains a simultaneously definitive and elusive authorial figure in Old Norse literature. 4 Skáldskaparmál is staged as a dialogue between the sea-giant, Ægir, and the god of poetry, Bragi. When Ægir asks Bragi how poetry originated, the god begins his explanation with a story set in the distant past. Bragi’s tale features two warring pantheons who establish peace by mixing all their spit together in a jar. To preserve this symbol of peace, the gods mould the spit into a man named Kvasir, who travels the world dispensing wisdom. However, two dwarfs covet Kvasir’s wisdom, so they murder him and mix his blood with honey to produce mead. Continuing with their malicious ways, the dwarfs become entangled in a feud with a clan of giants and are forced to turn over the mead to the giant

3 For some of the kennings alluding to the story of Suttungr’s mead, see Tarrin Wills, with Margaret Clunies Ross, Kari Ellen Gade, Guðrún Nordal, Edith Marold, Diana Whaley and Hannah Burrows (eds), Skaldic Poetry of the Scandinavian Middle Ages http://skaldic.abdn.ac.uk/db.php?if=default&table=database [accessed 20 May 2021]. 4 Roberta Frank has argued that much of Snorri’s account of the origins of the so-called ‘mead of poetry’ was self-devised, based on his own misreading and/ or misrepresentation of a number of Skaldic stanzas, though she does not dispute the drink’s association with poetry; see Roberta Frank, ‘Snorri and the Mead of Poetry’, in Ursula Dronke, Guðrún P. Helgadóttir, Gerd Wolfgang Weber, and Hans Bekker-Nielsen (eds), Specvlvm Norroenvm: Norse Studies in Memory of Gabriel Turville-Petre (Odense, 1981), pp. 155–70. The brief, corresponding account in the poem Hávamál bears several similarities to the account found in Snorri’s text, but there are also some crucial differences; see Svava Jakobsdóttir, ‘Gunnlǫð and the Precious Mead (Hávamál)’, trans. Katrina Attwood, in Paul Acker and Carolyne Larrington (eds), The Poetic Edda: Essays on Old Norse Mythology (New York and London, 2002), pp. 30–57.

INTRODUCTION

Suttungr as a ransom for their lives. This powerful drink is thenceforth known as Suttunga mjǫðr (Suttungr’s mead). The giant intends to keep the mead among his own clan, but the god Óðinn has other plans. Employing ruses, trickery, and shapeshifting, Óðinn schemes to steal the mead from Suttungr. After seducing the giant’s daughter, Gunnlǫð, he gathers all the mead in his mouth and transforms into an eagle to escape from the giants’ stronghold. Suttungr, who likewise takes on the form of an eagle, pursues Óðinn. When he approaches Ásgarðr, the home of the gods, Óðinn barely escapes Suttungr and empties the mead into containers which the other gods had set out for him. Óðinn then dispenses the mead among the gods and to those who can compose poetry. Yet, on account of the giant’s close pursuit, it is also said euphemistically that Óðinn ‘sendi aptr suman mjǫðinn’ (sent some of the mead backwards). While the story depicts the mead as valuable in any form, the gods disregarded this latter portion of the drink, which became free for the taking and was associated with lesser forms of poetry. Although Suttungr’s mead has primarily been associated with poetry, Bragi explains that whoever consumes this drink will become ‘skáld eða frœðamaðr’ (a poet or a scholar). 5

The prevalence of shapeshifting in Old Norse mythology, especially as a major feature of witchcraft or seiðr , may explain why both Óðinn and Suttungr can each immediately transform their bodies in order to take on animal forms as the situation requires – Óðinn also turns himself into a snake during the commission of the theft. Moreover, as scholars have often noted, the mead itself retains its properties of bestowing wisdom, though perhaps of different sorts, throughout all of its transformations, whether it exists as spit, a living man, a corpse, blood, mead, regurgitated liquid, and even bird droppings. 6 While Snorri Sturluson certainly recognized the ‘cul - tural capital’ Old Norse literary traditions could provide, 7 perhaps the true key to the mead miraculously retaining its insightful and inspiring nature

5 Snorri Sturluson, Edda: Skáldskaparmál , ed. Anthony Faulkes, 2 vols (London, 1998), vol. 1, pp. 3–5. Skáldskaparmál , along with a Prologue, Gylfaginning (The deluding of Gylfi) and Háttatal (Talk of meters), make up the Prose Edda , which dates to the early thirteenth century. Even accepting the attribution found only in the early fourteenth-century manuscript DG 11 4to (or Codex Upsaliensis), whether Snorri was the author of the text or its compiler remains an open question. For an overview on the authorial attribution and manuscript preservation of the Prose Edda , see Anthony Faulkes, ‘Introduction’, in Anthony Faulkes (ed.), Snorri Sturluson . Edda: Prologue and Gylfaginning (London, 2005), pp. xi–xxxii, at pp. xii–xvi, xxviii–xxxi. 6 O’Donoghue pp. 144, 148–9 in this volume also discusses the myth of Suttungr’s mead. 7 See Kevin J. Wanner, Snorri Sturluson and the Edda: The Conversion of Cultural Capital in Medieval Scandinavia (Toronto, 2008).

can be found in the fact that it links humanity to the divine world. Margaret Clunies Ross observes that, as a gift of the gods, poetry was ‘regarded as a vehicle for conveying major truths about the world and human life’. 8 In this myth, the poet ( skáld ) and the scholar are connected to one another through their shared inheritance of Suttungr’s mead. This connection speaks to their common function in uncovering, capturing, forming, and conveying knowl - edge, processes of transformation that remain at the heart of the modern critical and creative reception of Old Norse literature today. Considering many related or intrinsically linked forms of a given work creates a more holistic view of how it has evolved over time, a view that informs the following studies. In the first study, ‘Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in Medieval Iceland: Saga Realism and the Sworn Brothers’, Ármann Jakobsson reconsiders the well-es - tablished tendency to interpret the medieval Icelandic sagas (especially the so-called Íslendingasögur or Sagas of Icelanders ) as ‘realistic’ narratives that, in some way, anticipate realism in modern prose literature. Using the medieval Fóstbræða saga ( Saga of the Sworn Brothers ) as an illustrative example, he demonstrates how shedding the notion of ‘realism’ allows for a deeper and more compelling interpretation of the relationship between the eponymous foster-brothers in the saga. Ultimately, the dualist symbolism common to the medieval sagas and to Robert Louis Stevenson’s novel tran - scends a more mechanical view of literary representation – and plays a part in the contemporary resurgence of both weird fiction and folkloristics. Exploring perceptions beyond the limitations of well-established critical frameworks, the author suggests that insight may be gained into medieval Icelandic saga writing through the aesthetics of the paranormal. In ‘The Malleability of the Past: Íslendingabók as Narrative History’, Martina Ceolin approaches a foundational work for medieval Icelandic his - toriography, the twelfth-century Íslendingabók (Book of Icelanders) , with a critical eye towards the type of material that its author, Ari Þorgilsson, includes – and that which he seems to have omitted. She challenges earlier approaches to Icelandic historiographical writing and questions the role that unacknowledged projection and invention played in both the composition of Íslendingabók itself, and the modern critical traditions that surround it. Her analysis reveals that to the present day, certain uncritical assumptions live on within both scholarly discussions of Íslendingabók and popular contemporary attitudes in Iceland, ideas which reflect the transformative powers of both Ari Þorgilsson’s work and its subsequent historiography.

INTRODUCTION

In ‘Women’s Work and Material Culture in Medieval Iceland: Gender, Narrative, and Cloth Production’, Meghan Korten contrasts popular images of women’s work in medieval Iceland, literary accounts from Icelandic sagas, and archaeological evidence. The conventional dichotomy between the male public sphere and female domestic sphere, which characterizes gender-based approaches to medieval women’s history and popular contemporary images of medieval Scandinavian society, has validity in explaining some evidence. However, through her examination of Icelandic textile history in conjunc - tion with textual sources, including mythological references which attribute metaphysical significance to weaving, Korten demonstrates how factors other than strict notions of appropriate gender roles helped to determine the division of labour in medieval Icelandic society. In particular, kinship bonds and economic relationships – including elements ranging from social class to entrepreneurialism – prove capable of accounting for more than has often been recognized. Balancing all these factors is crucial to understanding how women shaped the culture of medieval Scandinavia. The theme of archaeology continues in some sense as Andrew McGillivray examines a core sample of Old Norse mythology in ‘ Vafþrúðnismál , from Parchment to Print: Stability and Change in the Transmission of Eddic Poetry’. Considering the various historical layers of the poem’s transmission, he chal - lenges intuitive assumptions and established scholarly notions asserting that the earliest, most original, or even best-preserved version of a medieval text provides the primary basis for a critical understanding of the work. Just as the myth of Suttungr’s mead pursues the provenance of the magical substance through numerous forms, McGillivray demonstrates that the many contex - tual transformations of one Old Norse text, the eddic poem Vafþrúðnismál (The Lay of Vafþrúðnir ), are crucial for a critical understanding of the text. The poem tells of a contest of wisdom between Óðinn and the titular giant Vafþrúðnir, in which the two mythical figures stake their lives on their secret knowledge of the past – a compelling scenario that was interpreted on the editorial level in vastly different ways over the course of many centuries. Óðinn remains a central focus in Ryan E. Johnson’s ‘The Odinic Motif: The Wanderer in the Mist’, which examines some of the many medieval and post-medieval avatars of the Norse god, with a focus on their archetypal struc - ture and awe-inspiring connection to the human psyche. These figures reveal a metamorphosis similar to human maturation and psychological development, from childlike wonder to an intellectual growth and wisdom. Johnson also considers how the archetypal elements of Odinic figures bridge a gap across different Old Norse literary genres and even extend to modern creative works inspired by the mysterious and powerful Norse god, including books by J.R.R. Tolkien and Neil Gaiman. Ultimately, across a wide variety of literary genres

and historical eras, each with its own distinct theology and zeitgeist, the same archetypal symbolism both persists and transforms, proving itself resilient enough to adapt to any number of potentially catastrophic scenarios and yet remain one step ahead, much like the wise and cunning Óðinn himself. Following Óðinn’s further journeys, Dustin Geeraert’s ‘What has Darwin to do with Óðinn? Shapeshifting, God and Nature in the “Great Story of the North”’, considers the role of doubt in stories about the Norse god, one who is after all known as a usurping, manipulative, and ruthless deity, as notorious for deception as for wisdom. Focusing on examples from the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, a time in which scientific controversies over human origins and evolution created upheavals in the public imagination, Geeraert examines the dialogue medievalist writers conducted with Old Norse works such as Völsunga saga and Snorri Sturluson’s Prose Edda, as well as with the Old English epic Beowulf . Tracking the dragon-slayer legend through the works of William Morris, J.R.R. Tolkien, and John Gardner, he considers the boundaries of the human in relation to witches, werewolves, gods, dwarfs, and dragons and demonstrates how these authors transformed their source materials in response to developments in nineteenth- and twentieth-century evolutionary biology and related fields. A comparable reinterpretation of traditional Old Norse stories within a milieu of cultural upheaval and alienation provides the focus for Heather O’Donoghue’s ‘Madness, Mythology, and Mitteleuropa: Günter Grass’s Transformation of Old Norse Myth The Tin Drum ’. O’Donoghue observes several striking parallels between certain episodes in Old Norse mythology and scenes in Grass’s novel Die Blechtrommel ( The Tin Drum ), which tells the story of Oskar Matzerath, a drummer with dwarfism, and is often clas - sified as part of the genre of ‘Magic Realism’. As discussed above, dwarfs are responsible for transforming Kvasir into Suttungr’s mead in Old Norse mythology. Examining the elusive lore of dwarfs, O’Donoghue considers the nature of literary aesthetics and mythological belief. She uncovers a myriad of fragments of Norse lore embedded in Grass’s strange and eerie story, and analyses the transformation of their context and meaning, from mythic narrative to modern novel. Another new perspective on Old Norse mythology emerges in ‘Once More, with Fiction: Transforming Myth in Gerður Kristný’s Blóðhófnir and the Eddic Poem Skírnismál ’. Here Christopher Crocker discusses the Icelandic poet Gerður Kristný’s Blóðhófnir ( Bloodhoof ), a verse retelling of the well- known mythic narrative of the Norse god Freyr, his servant Skírnir, and the giantess Gerðr, which is primarily based on the eddic poem Skírnismál ( The Lay of Skírnir ). He illustrates how certain narrative strategies employed by Gerður Kristný in her retelling imply an understanding of the mythic narra -

INTRODUCTION

tive that closely corresponds to feminist readings of the eddic poem, which the poet was perhaps unaware of. The fact that both the poet and scholars applying feminist readings to the eddic poem were responding to the same tra - ditional scholarly and popular understanding of the familiar mythic narrative provides a remarkable example of how the same kinds of cultural forces have frequently shaped both the creative and critical legacy of Old Norse literature. The study of the creative and critical legacies of Old Norse literature has, over the last two decades, been strengthened by numerous significant monographs and edited collections. 9 This volume aims to add to this thriving area of research through the original contributions described above. As M.J. Toswell observes in her evocative afterword, island nations like Iceland are in a unique position amidst the ebb and flow of cultures, religions, ideas, and institutions. The influence of these widely varying contexts can be seen throughout the history of Old Norse literature, from its origins and early development to the present day. As this volume’s studies strive to convey, the cultural legacies of Old Norse literature involve both preservation and transformation. Indeed, these legacies have likely proven so resilient and influential exactly because, like the gods and giants in the story of Suttungr’s mead, transformation seems to come to them so naturally.

9 Important monograph studies include Andrew Wawn’s The Viking and the Victorians: Inventing the Old North in Nineteenth-century Britain (Cambridge, 2000), Heather O’Donoghue’s From Asgard to Valhalla: The Remarkable History of the Norse Myths (London, 2007), and Jón Karl Helgason’s Echoes of Valhalla: The Afterlife of the Eddas and Sagas , trans.
