## The Odinic Motif: The Wanderer in the Mist
Ryan E. Johnson

A craggy, square face with pale gray eyes. The suit looked expensive, and was the color of melted vanilla ice cream. His tie was dark gray silk, and the tiepin was a tree, worked in silver: trunk, branches, and deep roots.

Neil Gaiman 1

In creating the alluring Mr Wednesday, as described above, Neil Gaiman drew inspiration from a mysterious figure that has appeared in Icelandic literature over many centuries. He is a wanderer, a counsellor, a shapeshifter, a magician, and a master of the outcome of battle. He is often mysteriously veiled in shadow, at times being revealed as the Norse god Óðinn. This paper aims to establish how characteristics of this god have been utilised to illumi - nate other characters with the same brilliance, and in what ways the divine and wise All-father brings his audience to childlike wonder. 2 The present discussion assesses and contrasts the literary and folkloristic associations with the recurrent Odinic character in a broad range of works. For example, the same wanderer motif that is used when introducing the god Óðinn in the work of the Danish historiographer, Saxo Grammaticus, is used to represent old wanderers that are instead associated with long past kings. These kings appear in the kings’ sagas, a type of medieval historiographical work created in Iceland where this motif makes several appearances. It is not always the god himself that has become important for the audience, but rather it is the motif that was created from him to strike awe in the receiver, whether they be a reader, listener, or viewer. We are witness to a myriad of medieval, modern,

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

and contemporary Odinic narratives through a particular set of lenses we might more naturally refer to as genres. This motif forms a kaleidoscope pattern under a set of Odinic lenses as we look through a history of works spanning more than a thousand years. In Gunnar Gunnarsson’s modern novel, Guest the One-Eyed (1913), orig - inally published in Danish as a volume of the Borgslægtens historie series ( The History of the Family at Borg ), a wonderful description of the Guest character utilizes not only one of Óðinn’s names but also the one eye and other characteristics of the Odinic motif: 3

His heavy coat dragged like the wings of a wounded bird. It was a picture well in keeping with the landscape, the man with his long white beard, the tangled grey hair showing below a big soft hat of the indeterminate colour of age. From beneath his bushy brows showed the glimpse of an eye – he had but one – almost unearthly in its intelligence and penetrating glance. His whole appearance, with his beggar’s pouch and limping gait, presented an almost unreal effect, harmonizing to a striking degree with the surroundings. He seemed to be in his element in this waste tract, beneath the low-lying clouds that at times almost enveloped him. 4

The wise old wanderer is a potent image that also appears consistently in eddic poetry. 5 In modern narrative his visage appears as characters such as Gaiman’s Mr. Wednesday, Gunnar Gunnarsson’s Guest, and even Gandalf in the Lord of the Rings . Gandalf, of course, being a figure of Tolkien’s imagina - tion, is recognized as a character shaped by the Norse god Óðinn. 6

The characters that have been shaped over time from mythological ele - ments form a collective imagination, with a history that spans further than

3 Gestur (Guest) is another of Óðinn’s many names. 4 Gunnar Gunnarsson, Guest the One-Eyed , trans. W.W. Worster (Toronto, 1922), p. 190. 5 Though recorded in the thirteenth century, eddic poetry contains much older knowledge. For instance, the fornyrðislag meter is often used. ‘ Fornyrðislag is equivalent to the verse form used in Old English, Old High German, and Old Saxon, the other Germanic languages in which verse has been preserved’: John Lindow, Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs (Oxford, 2002), pp. 14–5. 6 Tolkien distinctly remarks that he imagines Gandalf as an Odinic wanderer. See letter 107 in J.R.R. Tolkien, The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien , ed. Humphrey Carpenter (Boston, 1981), p. 119. Tom Shippey provides a thought-provoking analysis of the pagan roots of Tolkien’s writings, drawing especially from the Prose Edda and the Kalevala, in Tom Shippey, ‘Tolkien and the Appeal of the Pagan: Edda and Kalevala ’, in Roots and Branches: Selected Papers on Tolkien , Cormarë Series 11 (Zurich, 2007), pp. 19–38.

the written word. These stories point to human psychological patterns, and while one example is an anecdote, a collection of anecdotes form data points in a potentially massive data set. Carl Gustav Jung (1875–1961) was an early psychologist who saw great value in the mythologies found all over the world for the analysis of the human mind. In his analysis of his patients’ dreams, he formed conclusions about the psychological foundations of entities found in these dreams. These entities he referred to as archetypes, and he sought parallels with these psychological entities in mythology. Archetypes were comparable to the analysis of stories in folklore research using motifs. Jung understood this himself and contrasted his psychological idea with that of the motif. The concept of the motif brings together many stories found in a broad geographical range with similar concepts and themes. These concepts and themes have been classified by a few important scholars into large indices, the most well-developed of these indices is the Aarne-Thompson-Uther (ATU) index. 7 An index based on the Aarne-Thompson (AT) index was also devel - oped by Inger Margrethe Boberg specifically for Icelandic mythology and folklore. 8 Scholars have continued to see the value in both the categorization of archetypes and motifs. Evidence of interest in the motif index we see witnessed by Uther’s more recent enlargement of the index in 2004. In the introduction to Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature , the editors say, ‘While a motif is a unit of interest in a tale or some other genre such as a proverb, joke, ballad, or riddle, an archetype is a pattern of primary significance with deep psychic resonance that also occurs in various literary genres’. 9 In another example from 2005, a considerable study of this very theme in relation to Old Norse deities was authored by Greg Mogenson. 10

As these two latter publications illustrate, interest in the relationship of arche - types with folk culture and mythology has hardly waned since Jung’s original analyses of these phenomena. For the present purpose, the figure of the wise old man can most easily be associated with the Jungian archetype known as the senex . Carl Jung defines

archetype as ‘a tendency to form such representations of a motif – representa - tions that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern. There are, for instance, many representations of the motif of the hostile breth - ren, but the motif itself remains the same’. 11 Jung speaks of the mythological in connection with the psyche. He tells us that ‘In so far as through our unconscious we have a share in the historical collective psyche, we live naturally and unconsciously in a world of werewolves, demons, magicians, etc., for these are things which all previous ages have invested with tremen - dous affectivity’. 12 He terms this phenomenon the collective unconscious or collective psyche, something quite different from the individual psyche, but which must be reconciled with the individual psyche through the maturation process. He continues:

The collective unconscious, being the repository of man’s experience, is an image of the world which has taken aeons to form. In this image certain features, the archetypes or dominants, have crystallized out in the course of time. They are the ruling powers, the gods, images of the dominant laws and principles, and of typical, regularly occurring events in the soul’s cycle of experience. In so far as these images are more or less faithful replicas of psychic events, their archetypes, that is, their general characteristics which have been emphasized through the accumulation of similar experiences, also correspond to certain general characteristics of the physical world. Archetypal images can therefore be taken metaphorically, as intuitive con - cepts for physical phenomena. 13

Jung goes on in his essay to advise the reader that in the process of indi - viduation the individual psyche must grapple with the archetypes of their unconscious mind, also termed the collective psyche, and he shows how this is a facet of his therapeutic method through dream analysis. The senex of Jungian psychology is a concept associated with the terms anima and animus , the opposite inner gender in an individual’s subcon - scious. There are four stages of the animus , 1) the wholly physical man, 2) the ‘romantic’ man or the ‘man of action’, 3) the bearer of the ‘word’, and 4) the wise guide to spiritual truth. 14 Three of these stages, 2–4, are easily

recognized in the god Óðinn. The man of action correlates with Óðinn’s role in battle, the bearer of the ‘word’ correlates with him as a god of poetry and his role in the acquisition of the mead of poetry, and the wise guide to spiritual truth where he provides guidance and dispenses wisdom. As will be seen, the wholly physical man is also not out of reach for the wandering Odinic figure. When the inner masculine figure of the woman is ‘viewed mythologically’ as a ‘beautiful stranger’, the animus ‘is probably a pagan father-image or god-image, who appears […] as king of the dead’. 15 A representation of this in Óðinn can be seen when considering him as Valfaðir , ‘Father of the Slain’, 16

and his connection to the valkyrjur. 17 Óðinn and the valkyrjur are chthonic entities that share access to the battle slain, the einherjar . 18 The roles of the Greek god Hades and Óðinn are also similar in that they exert at least some aggressive control over the feminine, a role which can be taken on by the animus of the feminine psyche. 19 Jung also points to chthonic characteristics as a part of the anima . 20

A person can grow to clearly identify with their ‘Self’ through the indi - viduation process. 21 The end goal, although often unrealized, is to become a centred individual, and amongst animus type figures perceived to embody this, a representation of the senex is visible. In direct relation with the male

15 The example provided in association with this phenomenon by the Jungian, Marie- Luise von Franz, is the abduction of Persephone by Hades. See Franz, ‘The Process of Individuation’, p. 202. 16 Carolyne Larrington (trans.), The Poetic Edda (Oxford, 2014), pp. 4, 7. 17 Hades was later named Pluto by the Greeks, perhaps out of fear of saying the god of the underworld’s name. 18 In the poem ‘Darraðarljóð’ (The Song of Spears), the Valkyries weave cloth from the entrails of men who died in the Battle of Clontarf. Robert Cook (trans.), Njal’s Saga (London, 2001), pp. 303–7. In the eddic poem ‘Grímnismál’ (Grimnir’s Sayings), it is revealed that the Valkyries are also subservient to men, as they serve mead to the warriors of Valhalla; see Larrington (trans.), The Poetic Edda , pp. 50–60. 19 One of the examples brandished by Jungian psychology for this figure is the story of Bluebeard, a folk tale about a nobleman who takes on beautiful wives and sub - sequently murders them. In connection to the aggressive dominance of the male figure, Hades abducts Persephone whereas Óðinn has various exploits bedding women, especially giantesses. 20 Jung points to classical Chinese philosophy in connection with the anima and the ‘feminine and chthonic part of the soul’, see Carl G. Jung, The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious (London, 1959), p. 59. 21 This process was perceived by Jung through his subject’s dreams, but it was seen as encompassing the totality of one’s psyche, greater than the ego itself; see Franz, ‘The Process of Individuation’, pp. 161–2.

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

psyche, Jung defines these figures alternatively as logos , though we will for the sake of simplicity only refer to them as animus in the present discussion. 22

Marie-Luise von Franz tells us that the centred individual is revealed:

If an individual has wrestled seriously enough and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form, representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the psyche. […] In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian guru ), a wise old man, a spirit of nature, and so forth. 23

The chaos of one’s thoughts appear to coalesce into something more stable at this point, the questioning of the other entity ( animus ) is quieted and replaced by the stable same entity (centred individual), with greater patience and psychological features garnered from experience. The parallels to the wise old man that Óðinn appears as are striking. A strand is apparent in Jungian psychology’s view of the human psyche that has parallels with the Norse mythographical universe. 24 Jung used mythology to analyse the dreams of his patients and came to an understanding of how human psychology is shaped in the maturation process of the individual. Coupled with a Lacanian view of how the individual develops, at childhood we see our superiors before us, marvel at their perceived ingenuity, and attempt to mimic them. 25

22 Jung refers to the same-sex archetype of the male psyche or ‘spirit’ as logos and the female as eros . See Carl G. Jung, ‘Commentary on “The Secret of the Golden Flower,”’ in Alchemical Studies (London, 1967), pp. 40–1. Jung’s analysis is a bit dated in this way, as other points of his analysis can be as well. He is unable to see the possibility that men and women might be more comfortable and better paired with their opposite gender as their natural ‘spirit’. This can be contrasted by the Old Norse view of sexuality as described by Carol Clover, ‘Regardless of Sex: Men, Women, and Power in Early Northern Europe,’ Speculum , 68:2 (1993), 363–87. 23 As we can see by this, although the animus is associated with the feminine psyche, it is what the male psyche is driven to become, as the centred individual takes on characteristics of the animus . From here on I take the liberty of referring to Óðinn’s qualities from this perspective of the animus , alluding to the four defined stages; see Franz, ‘The Process of Individuation’, pp. 207–8. 24 The OED defines ‘mythography’ as: 1) The representation or depiction of mythical subjects in art, 2) The compilation, description, or analysis of myths. Also: a critical anthology of myths, and 3) The creation of a body of myths by a particular society, culture, or person; the myths so created: Oxford English Dictionary http:// www.oed.com [accessed 20 May 2021]. 25 ‘It is the stability of the standing posture, the prestige of stature, the impressive - ness of statues, which set the style for the identification in which the ego finds its starting-point and leave their imprint in it for ever’: Jacques Lacan, ‘Some Reflections on the Ego’, The International Journal of Psycho-Analysis , 34:1

In this light, it is not surprising that modern representations of the Odinic and Óðinn persist. In modern literature, the Odinic is obvious in Tolkien’s characterization of Gandalf the Grey and White, and his transition from Grey to White in the novels is an expression of a move to a centred individual. Gandalf the Grey is the wise wanderer who fights the Balrog, while the White transcends the physical realm, requiring merely the word to make substantial change to the environment. 26 Due to the persistent presence of the Odinic theme, the wanderer motif bridges a gap across Icelandic genres: the legend - ary sagas, the Icelandic Family Sagas, and the kings’ sagas. The general trend is an emphasis on the description of the character and his disappearance at the end. It is intriguing to consider the roots of the ancient archetype that stand behind medieval and modern examples. 27

The god Óðinn has many defining features. As Georges Dumézil admits, ‘It would be a lengthy task even to present a bare inventory of what the literary tradition tells us about the god Odin. All we can hope to do is describe the most important aspects and state the most characteristic facts’. 28

Dumézil follows a trend among some scholars, labelling things Odinic that are associated with but not clearly represented as the god himself. Prior scholars have written about Óðinn and the motif elements that recur around this character in Old Norse literature. Three of these scholars are John McKinnell, Richard North, and Jeffrey Mazo. John McKinnell, in his Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend , looks at Odinic motifs in lieu of being able to reconstruct a coherent myth. Richard North moves the motif beyond the god toward a different character from the Íslendingasögur (Icelandic Family Sagas), Egill Skalla-Grímsson, allowing Egill to take on the motif elements that encompass Óðinn. 29 Jeffrey Mazo singles out ‘the Odinic motif of Odin in disguise’, when comparing a variety of Old Norse

(1953), 11–17, at p. 15. 26 ‘‘Come back, Saruman!’ said Gandalf in a commanding voice. To the amazement of the others, Saruman turned again, and as if dragged against his will, he came slowly back to the iron rail, leaning on it, breathing hard’: J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings , 3 vols (London, 1999), vol. 2, p. 229. 27 An interesting and somewhat comical overview of the modern influence of Óðinn can be found in Jón Karl Helgason, Echoes of Valhalla: The Afterlife of the Eddas and Sagas , trans. Jane Victoria Appleton (London, 2017), pp. 133–52. 28 Georges Dumézil, Gods of the Ancient Northmen , Publications of the UCLA Center for the Study of Comparative Folklore and Mythology 3 (Berkeley, 1977), p. 26. Dumézil proceeds to recount a tally of these characteristic facts about Óðinn. His tally is worth review. 29 Richard North, Pagan Words and Christian Meanings , Costerus 81 (Amsterdam, 1991).

sources. 30 Joseph Harris and Thomas D. Hill also speak of the Odinic in contrast to Óðinn himself. 31

Like Carl Jung’s view of the archetype, the representations of the wan - derer motif vary without losing their overall pattern. The basic pattern is a character drawn as a wanderer with a description of his clothing and personal effects. He then imparts knowledge and disappears. The type of effect this artistic mode has on the receiver is potent, and the reason for this potency is the character’s relation to elements of the human psyche, both the inner dialogue someone has with whom they perceive as the ideal person (often the mother or father, but in this context, an extension to forefathers is possible), and the ideal that the individual strives to become and perhaps eventually does become.

Eddic Poetry

Scholars have wrestled with the concept of the Odinic, even though at times it is used in representations of characters other than the god himself in Old Norse literature. 32 The indirect representation of the god Óðinn by this motif parallels the way in which he walks the earth in Old Norse eddic poetry. In this poetry, Óðinn is a god of many names and many guises, fooling even his son in Hárbarðsljóð ( Harbard’s Song ) when disguised as a ferryman. Having great wisdom, he makes a fool of Þór with his especially acerbic wit. 33 Óðinn

Hill, ‘Gestr’s “Prime Sign”: Source and Signification in Norna-Gests þáttr’, Arkiv för nordisk filologi , 104 (1989), 103–22. 32 Annette Lassen and John McKinnell appear to prefer looking solely at the god Óðinn in their scholarship. They do not move into the Odinic. However, Lassen provides an interesting contribution to this conversation with her work on Óðinn throughout medieval Norse literature, but especially in relation to Ólafs saga Tryggvasonar by Oddr munkr; see Annette Lassen, Odin på kristent pergament: en teksthistorisk studie (Copenhagen, 2011), pp. 139–48; Annette Lassen, ‘Gud eller djævel?: kristningen af Odin’, in Rudolf Simek and Judith Meurer (eds), Scandinavia and Christian Europe in the Middle Ages: Papers of The 12th International Saga Conference Bonn/Germany, 28th July–2nd August 2003 (Bonn, 2005), pp. 326–36; McKinnell does work with an idea of the Odinic motif but con - fines his discussion to the figure of the god himself; see John McKinnell, Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend (Woodbridge, 2005). 33 Óðinn makes this clear when, disguised as Hárbarðr, he says, ‘I never thought

crosses into other worlds as an anonymous wanderer quite frequently. For example, in Vafþrúðnismál ( Vafþrúðnir’s Sayings ) he wanders into the world of giants as Gagnráður (Speaker Who Has the Advantage, or He Who Has Opposing or Useful Counsel), 34 and in Grímnismál ( Grimnir’s Sayings ) he wanders into the human world as Grímnir (The Masked One). Grímnismál revolves around Óðinn as a patriarch of kings within a mythical narrative. Here he is pitted against his wife, Frigg, in a bet about which of two brothers, Geirröður and Agnar, should be fashioned king. Óðinn takes on the role of the strange wanderer and dispenses knowledge. A specific piece of knowledge that must be kept in mind for our present com - parison is the idea that sets the action in motion. Geirröður is accused by Frigg of being inhospitable to his guests. In the end, he is punished for his unwelcoming behaviour towards Óðinn, and Agnar is ultimately rewarded for an act of kindness. Óðinn is set apart from the other gods of the Norse pantheon as a figure that bestows knowledge upon people. He is the god of poetry and the runes, a ‘bearer of the word’ to put it in Jungian terms. Óðinn sacrifices himself to himself on the gallows of the tree Yggdrasill. In the poem Hávamál , this sac - rifice is recounted. Óðinn peers down from the gallows where he is hanging and takes up the runes and is given a drink of ‘precious mead’. He begins to quicken and become wise, subsequently recounting this verse:

Rúnar munt þú finna ok ráðna stafi, mjǫk stóra stafi, mjǫk stinna stafi, er fáði fimbulþulr ok gørðu ginnregin ok reist Hroptr rǫgna. 35

(The runes you must find and the meaningful letter, a very great letter, a very powerful letter, which the mighty sage stained and the powerful gods made and the runemaster of the gods carved out.) 36

Asa-Thor would let a ferryman make a fool of him’: Larrington (trans.), The Poetic Edda , p. 76. 34 The prefix gagn - can have either a sense of usefulness or opposition, and the substan - tive, ráðr , can mean ‘advisor, leader, or proprietor.’ One manuscript uses Gangráðr instead; see McGillivray p. 71 in this volume. The prefix gang - provides a sense of movement, not a completely removed idea from the wanderer type figure. 35 Jónas Kristjánsson and Vésteinn Ólason (eds), Eddukvæði , 2 vols, Íslenzk fornrit (Reykjavík, 2014), vol. 1, p. 351. 36 Larrington (trans.), The Poetic Edda , p. 34.

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

The god’s sacrifice accentuates the importance of the symbols crafted by the gods and the knowledge that follows. In addition, the wisdom that Óðinn provides humans is exemplified by Hávamál ( Sayings of the High One ). The wisdom is remarkably common. Many readers walk away from a first reading saying to themselves that it is all simply common-sense. One section deals specifically with how an individual should act as a traveller and in the company of others. It deals with how one should keep quiet if they know not of what they speak, or at times more importantly, how one should be mindful of those within earshot.

At augabragði skala maðr annan hafa, þótt til kynnis komi; margr þá fróðr þykkisk, ef hann freginn erat ok nái hann þurrfjallr þruma.

(Into a laughing-stock no man should make another, though he comes on a visit; many a man seems wise if he isn’t asked questions and he manages to lurk unscathed.)

Fróðr þykkisk sá er flótta tekr gestr at gest hæðinn; veita gǫrla sá er um verði glissir, þótt hann með grǫmum glami.

(Wise that man seems who retreats when one guest is insulting another; the man who mocks others at a feast doesn’t really know whether he’s shooting off his mouth amid enemies.)

Gumnar margir erusk gagnhollir en at virði v rekask; aldar róg þat mun æ vera, órir gestr við gest. 37

(Many men are devoted to one another and yet they fight at feasts; amongst men there will always be strife, guest quarrelling with guest.) 38

This type of wisdom is weaved throughout the sagas when fighting breaks out during a feast. Below, one such episode will be discussed from the kings’ saga manuscript Flateyjarbók . According to eddic poetry, Óðinn is wise but also has a short temper when dealing with fools, even with his son, refusing to ferry him after they engage in a traditional poetic quarrel. On top of being a ferryman, Óðinn is a wide-ranging wanderer, venturing to various worlds, even going so far as to sacrifice himself for knowledge on the gallows of the tree of life, Yggdrasill. He tests his knowledge by pitting himself against a giant of great wisdom in Vafþrúðnismál . The knowledge that he provides to humans in Grímnismál is in the nature of a father teaching his children good manners, and Hávamál mirrors these concepts of good behaviour while being a guest. Of note here is how the sacrifice for knowledge, and the imparting of knowledge, connects to the concept of ‘the bearer of the word’. Also of note from Grímnismál is Óðinn as a patriarch of kings. This connects to the patriarchal element of the animus as a parent’s intellect being imprinted on a child. The successful father and forefathers are models to be exemplified.

Saxo Grammaticus and Snorri Sturluson

The text called the Prose Edda attributed to Snorri Sturluson describes a great deal of Norse mythology in prose form. In the prologue to the Prose Edda , there is a description of a euhemeristic view, one where the gods are men who become so renowned that they are revered as gods, and with no difficulty are crowned chieftains and kings. These renowned men are said to have a unique beauty and wisdom. 39 Snorri equates the Norse gods to the Graeco-Roman tradition. Óðinn is not equated with a Graeco-Roman god directly but is connected by a father, in this case Þór, who was a citizen of Troy. This mortal Óðinn is said to be ‘an excellent man because of his wisdom and because he had every kind of accomplishment’. 40 Through his own and his wife’s prescience, they understand that he will become the most renowned of Northern kings, should they travel there. Snorri does not treat these stories

39 ‘When the king learned of the journey of these Asians, who were called Æsir, he went to meet them, offering to grant Odin as much authority in his kingdom as he wanted. Wherever they stayed in these lands a time of peace and prosperity accompanied their journey, so that all believed the newcomers were the cause. This was because the local inhabitants saw that they were unlike any others they had known in beauty and intelligence’: Snorri Sturluson, The Prose Edda , trans. Jesse Byock (London, 2005), p. 7. 40 Snorri Sturluson, The Prose Edda , p. 6.

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

as silly, though humour in his account is prevalent. He provides reasoning for a Christian mind to allow that the people of the North lost their way, but, as scripture suggests, they could see the great works of God through nature, though they were led astray. 41

The euhemerism present in the prologue of the Prose Edda provides an interesting launching pad for the further discussion of Óðinn, and his relationship with the Odinic of Old Norse and Icelandic literature. The first description of him in the prologue as a human man is that ‘hann var ágætr maðr af speki ok allri atgørvi’ (he was an excellent man in wisdom and all pursuits). 42 It goes on to say that he had prescience ( spádómr ) and that with these magic arts or lore ( vísendi ) he was able to foresee that his name would long be remembered in the northern half of the world and ‘tígnat um framm alla konunga’ (honoured above all kings). 43 And thus the oldest Norse legendary figure comes to light, the father of all the northern kings, to be held in the greatest honour over all kings. Saxo Grammaticus, on the other hand, does not make the same kind of ancestral leap between the Norse and the Graeco-Roman. He does, however, appear to make equivalencies between both traditions. Óðinn is equated with Pluto, the god of the underworld, who has also been referred to as Hades. 44 Saxo describes Óðinn in a direct appearance with his characteristic features, and there is no disguising his name. The description is as ‘an old man, very tall and with only one eye, wrapped in a shaggy cloak’. 45 Later, Saxo no longer feels the need to describe the old wanderer but rather simply says that ‘Odin, assuming the disguise of his name and clothing, carried out a deceitful embassy’. 46

41 John McKinnell succinctly describes this element of Snorri’s Prologue: ‘The Prologue thus argues that pre-Christian myth originated either because people wor - shipped natural forces or because human rulers arrogated to themselves the status of gods. But these humans are not condemned, as they are, for example, in Ælfric’s De Falsis Diis and by Saxo’: McKinnell, Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend , p. 44. By worshipping what could be seen in nature they saw the forces of God at work, and so were simply lost: ‘They that go down into the sea with ships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep’ (Psalm 107: 23–4). 42 Snorri Sturluson, Edda Snorra Sturlusonar: Udgivet Efter Håndskrifterne, ed.

Saxo also transforms Óðinn into a human through a euhemeristic view. 47

Saxo’s Óðinn is a counsellor in his work, who has much to do with war and battle technique. Georges Dumézil believed that the Poetic Edda and Snorri’s Prose Edda were the starting point for understanding the Óðinn ‘of Saxo and of the sagas’, these latter works being ‘historical as well as romantic’. 48 Unlike both the Eddas, the narratives found elsewhere take on a historical timeframe, rather than a purely mythical one where time is completely displaced from the events. Although Saxo’s work probably slightly predates Snorri’s (both works originally dated to the first half of the thirteenth century in some form), it is Snorri’s work that attempts an explanation for the earlier poetic forms of the myths that were passed down by the Poetic Edda (although differences in detail can be found). From this, it can be discerned that the battle tested Óðinn is well explained by Snorri. Dumézil sums up this facet as, ‘One part of Odin’s talents as enumerated by Snorri applied especially to war: paralysis of the enemy troops, “madness” increasing by tenfold the normal powers of the favoured soldiers’. 49

Early in Saxo’s work, the story of Hadingus is told. The first episode featuring this Odinic hero sees him grow up as the son of Gram and Signe. His father and brother are killed and Hadingus vows vengeance. He is then seduced by Harthgrepa, a giantess, who was also his nursemaid. She is assailed and dies. Hadingus is alone when a one-eyed wanderer finds him and introduces him to a pirate. Together, the two men wage war but they are defeated and Hadingus is injured. The old man then takes him away and cares for him, before setting him up to do battle with a beast (perhaps a lion), and then upon victory having him feed on the heart of that beast. At the end of the episode, Hadingus returns after this initiation rite to avenge his father and brother’s death. 50

It was assumed by some that Saxo Grammaticus had not associated the wanderer folk motif directly with the god Óðinn. This is not surprising, seeing that in Book 1, Saxo relates the episode where Hadingus is rescued by the old man with one eye, then separates episodes of Hadingus with a man

47 ‘Saxo offered a theory of euhemerism similar to that of Snorri, for he says in book 1 that Odin was a man falsely believed to be a god’: Lindow, Norse Mythology , p. 27. 48 Dumézil, Gods of the Ancient Northmen , p. 26. 49 Dumézil, Gods of the Ancient Northmen , p. 29. 50 Saxo Grammaticus, The History of the Danes , vol. 1, pp. 21–5. This type of initia - tion rite can also be found in the legendary sagas, for example when Sigurður the Dragon-Slayer kills his dragon and eats the heart to discover he can understand the song of birds; see Jesse L. Byock (trans.), The Saga of the Volsungs: The Norse Epic of Sigurd the Dragon Slayer (Enfield Lock, UK, 1993), pp. 65–6.

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

named ‘Odin’, seemingly unassociated with the old one-eyed man. In his From Myth to Fiction translated in 1973, Georges Dumézil provides some argument against the assumption that Saxo was unaware that the old one- eyed man was one and the same as the ‘Odin’ about whom he subsequently writes. 51 As Dumézil notes, ‘The character of Odin is complex and not very reassuring. His face hidden under his hood, in his somber blue cloak, he goes about the world, simultaneously master and spy’. 52

In Saxo’s Hadingus legend, Odinic qualities are clearly associated with the old wanderer. Hadingus again crosses paths with an old wanderer and an Odinic narrative unfolds afresh.

Hading noticed an old man on the shore waving his mantle to and fro to indicate that he wished him to put in to land. Though his fellow-sailors grumbled that this deviation from their route would be disastrous, he took him aboard and found in him the man to supervise the disposition of his troops. He had this careful system for the arrangement of his columns: in the first row he would put two men, four in the second, then increase the third to eight, and step up each succeeding rank by doubling the numbers of the one in front. It was he who ordered the contingents of slingers at the sides to drop back into the rear and attached them to the lines of archers. […] At his departure following Hading’s victory the old man predicted that he would not be destroyed through foemen’s violence but by a self-chosen kind of death, and at the same time told him he must go in for glorious campaigns, not petty fighting, and seek action in remote parts rather than on his borders. 53

The battle plans the old wanderer disseminates to the troops are detailed and mark him out as equivalent to the animus stage of the man of action. The events overall touch on the parental duty of caretaker with the wanderer coming to Hadingus’s aid, and earlier as a guide through initiation by having him eat the heart of the beast. As the old man by the sea, he is a useful counsellor, despite the fact the crew initially had wanted nothing to do with him. His appearance is clearly Odinic and correlates with other stories in the fornaldarsögur (legendary sagas).

51 Georges Dumézil, From Myth to Fiction: The Saga of Hadingus , trans. Derek Coltman (Chicago, 1973), p. 41 n. 9; This assumption still persists in Jens Peter Schjødt’s work, where he allows for Saxo’s ignorance as the unwitting chronicler; see Jens Peter Schjødt, Initiation Between Two Worlds: Structure and Symbolism in Pre-Christian Scandinavian Religion , trans. Victor Hansen, Viking Collection 17 (Odense, 2008), p. 272 n. 5. 52 Dumézil, Gods of the Ancient Northmen , p. 30. 53 Saxo Grammaticus, The History of the Danes , vol. 1, p. 31.

In the Prose Edda , the god is described as a god of battle, and in Saxo this point is more clearly shown. While in Saxo’s work it is the old wanderer who comes to the aid of the battle weary, in the Prose Edda , like the Poetic Edda , he comes to find knowledge by wandering throughout worlds. In the Prose Edda , he is acknowledged as having had human form and, in this form, to have been viewed as a god because of his unique qualities. When the mythical narrative of the Prose Edda begins to unfold, a king from Sweden named Gylfi travels to Ásgarðr to ask the Æsir, the group of gods that Óðinn is head of, about how everything appears to go according to their wishes. When he approaches, he is greeted by three men, High, Just-as-High, and Third. The place is referred to as the hall of the High One. Asked about his business by these three, he responds that he is seeking a wise man in the hall. High says that he will not get away unharmed if he does not become wiser. And so, both the euhemeristic prologue and the mythical narrative speak of travel and the acquisition of wisdom during travel. While in Saxo we have the man of action, in the Prose Edda we are instead in the presence of a wise spiritual guide to truth.

Kings’ Sagas

John McKinnell has directed attention to the dual nature of how the Odinic is expressed, especially noting how the invocation of his name or presence can be made in a sympathetic or unsympathetic manner. 54 For unsympathetic examples, McKinnell points to Oddur Snorrason’s Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar , Ynglinga saga , the prologue of the Prose Edda and Gautreks saga . In Ynglinga saga , it is said that Óðinn was followed by twelve leaders in the magic arts and that these höfðingjar (magnates) received sacrifices from others and were called their gods. 55 The Prose Edda makes mention of those who lost their way from God and worship things such as celestial objects. Gautreks saga, however, appears the least forgiving of all these sources, where people who live in the forest of western Gautland throw themselves from a precipice to appease Óðinn, hoping to find life in Valhalla. The patri - arch of this family wears a wide-brimmed hat and lets the brim droop over

54 John McKinnell, Both One and Many: Essays in Change and Variety in Late Norse Heathenism , with an Appendix by Maria Elena Ruggerini (Rome, 1994), pp. 131–2; Annette Lassen also points to the positive and negative traits of Óðinn, and in a similar vein as McKinnell, she discusses the negative characterizations of Óðinn as the devil; see Lassen, Odin på kristent pergament . 55 Snorri Sturluson, Heimskringla , ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnason, 3 vols, Íslenzk fornrit 26–28 (Reykjavík, 1941–51), vol. 1, pp. 19–20.

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

one eye, representative of the one-eyed Óðinn. However, wisdom appears to be lacking in this family, as the tone of the scene suggests that this is a representation of a people who are completely lost. 56

For the sympathetic view, the Odinic is intermingled with mistaken identity, or at the very least a shroud of mystery. In the early thirteenth-century kings’ sagas found in the manuscript called Morkinskinna , there is an Odinic figure in Magnúsar saga góða , where an old blind man in a hat hinders Magnús from having a sexual affair with Margrét Þrándardóttir. 57 Another sympathetic account of an Odinic figure appears in connection with a king, this time Ólafur Tryggvason, in an episode of a later manuscript from the late fourteenth-cen - tury Flateyjarbók , referred to as ‘Halldórs þáttr Snorrasonar’. 58 A grímumaður (masked man) appears to purchase Einar Þambarskelfir and his comrades out of slavery. In return, Einar is required to come to the aid of another man at some point in the future. The grímumaður not only points to the Odinic in his name (obvious connections can be made with the name Grímnir , meaning ‘Masked One’), but in his clothing and behaviour as well. The figure calls up images of Óðinn from Grímnismál venturing into the lands of men to bring favour to those who deserve his appreciation because of their acts toward their fellow man. This is a parallel to the above-mentioned poem Hávamál . Halldór gets into trouble at the outset of this rendition of his tale because he is offended by the behaviour of another, becoming his killer. 59 Einar aids Halldór in the matter and offers up a story as his reason. The story is a mysterious one, taking place during the aftermath of the Battle of Svolder.

56 ‘The worship of Óðinn is mercilessly mocked, the implication being that it encour - ages treachery and especially meanness, and that worshippers of Óðinn are gullible fools who seek out dwellings in remote places in order to escape the consequences of their own inadequacies and misdeeds’: McKinnell, Both One and Many , p. 131. 57 Ármann Jakobsson and Þórður Ingi Guðjónsson (eds), Morkinskinna , 2 vols, Íslenzk fornrit 23–4 (Reykjavík, 2011), vol. 1, pp. 148–51. The man tells her what to say in order to stop the king from advancing his sexual desire and offers more solid evidence by placing his hand on Margrét’s breast, creating a mark. When she tells Magnús what she was told to say, Magnús immediately retreats. The point here would be to show averseness to having a sexual relationship with a woman who has had a sexual affair with another man of the same ilk, that is to say closely related. The affair here can be considered in connection with canon law, considering that the saga was probably written shortly after the Fourth Lateran Council; see Theodore M. Andersson and Kari Ellen Gade (trans.), Morkinskinna: The Earliest Icelandic Chronicle of the Norwegian Kings (1030–1157) (Ithaca, NY, 2000), pp. 431–2. 58 Sigurður Nordal (ed.), Flateyjarbók , 4 vols (Reykjavík, 1944–5), vol. 1, pp. 215–18. 59 An episode featuring Halldór is also found in Morkinskinna and Hulda , but there it is of a completely different nature and the legendary elements are missing; see Ármann Jakobsson and Þórður Ingi Guðjónsson (eds), Morkinskinna , vol. 1, pp. 178–87.

The legendary naval vessel, Ormurinn langi (The Long Serpent), is lost, and Einarr is taken to be sold into slavery. The mysterious grímumaður appears, a great man in a long cowl with a mask upon his face who purchases three men and without counting his money drops it into the slaver’s lap. The fetters are loosed from the men and the masked man wanders away into the forest. Einar, one of those freed, follows him and bids him tell his name. The man says that he does not know his own name, although perhaps a day will come when he does, but what he does know is that there have been days when he ruled over more than three men. In payment, Einar is to show no less kindness to a man who does something despicable enough to him, warranting death. He then misdirects their attention and disappears. The men believe that the wanderer was King Ólafur Tryggvason, the king that reportedly died with his ship, Ormurinn langi , and before he disappears the masked man foretells the fortunes of all three men. The most interesting feature of both the story of Magnús góði and the tale of Halldór is the way that two kings, both of whom brought the Christian religion to the areas they ruled over, are associated with an Odinic figure after their own deaths. It would seem that the attempt is not made in an effort to recognize any particular religious idea, doctrine or even notion, though canon law may have played a role in the authorship and reception of the episode of Magnús góði, but there does seem to be more an attempt to use Odinic features to create the air of legend around the king who is associated with the strange character at the end of the tale. This associates him with a character carrying a portent or numinous knowledge, but usually imparting, or rather accentuating, common-sense knowledge, like that of a parent instructing their child. Although Óðinn seeks out others for knowledge, it is he who proves to possess the most, and he typically defeats others in wisdom contests as seen in Vafþrúðnismál , Gátur Gestumblinda ( The Riddles of the Blind Guest ), 60 and Hárbarðsljóð where he utterly crushes his own son, Þór. Óðinn’s reasoning for not ferrying Þór in the aftermath of his defeat seems related less to the defeat itself and more to the way in which Þór behaves. Óðinn is unwilling to tolerate Þór’s hubris from the beginning. It is then quite fitting to see an Odinic character come to the aid of Halldór Snorrason in the episode previ - ously outlined from Flateyjarbók , where Halldór kills a man for his insolent behaviour while drinking. This þáttr (episode) of Halldór Snorrason parallels the eddic poem Hávamál as it was illustrated above.

60 Christopher Tolkien (ed. and trans.), The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise (London, 1960), p. 32. See also McGillivray p. 78 in this volume where he refers to Gátur Gestumblinda as ‘Gest speki’ or Heiðreks gátur .

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

With the understanding of the dichotomy represented by the sympathetic and the unsympathetic narrator, it seems that, far from seeking sympathy from those who tell his stories, Óðinn does not request praise of any kind. He acts rather as the animus of action, 61 as, for example, when he deposes the king who acts unfavourably. In Grímnismál , he is goaded by Frigg into wagering as to who is the better of two men because his then favoured man is accused of inhospitable behaviour towards his guests. When Óðinn is treated inhospitably by the favoured and hospitably by the ill-favoured, he switches allegiances. In comparison with the appearance of the grímumaður in the episode of Halldór Snorrason, the behaviour of the man killed should be considered. The grímumaður never reveals the name of the man to be taken under Einar’s protection; he simply says that a time will come when a man does him a great injustice, but he will stay his hand. Perhaps the decision was Einar’s all along, but Óðinn gave him a model to help him make the right decision after an even-handed appraisal of such situations, as has been outlined in Hávamál . He is depicted as the bearer of the word in Hávamál, and this word is the basis for the wise guide to spiritual truth we see awakened in the name of dead kings.

Legend and Medieval Icelandic Historiography

As has been seen, within the kings’ sagas of Morkinskinna and Flateyjarbók , there are interesting connections with Odinic elements. In one episode of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar , ‘Norna-Gests þáttr’, a man named Gestur (Guest) wanders into King Ólafur’s court. Though this episode is found within the saga of this king, it is also considered a legendary tale in its own right. This is an interesting mingling of genres. Genres are conceptual categories that have been created to help us understand the complexities of a myriad of oral, literary, and visual constructs, and thus their utility in such a case is of interest. The episode of Norna-Gestur is not found in the earliest source of the saga of Ólafur Tryggvason, the saga written by the Benedictine monk, Oddur Snorrason. Unlike the depiction of Óðinn as the devil in Oddur’s version, in the þáttr the Odinic character is a Christian initiate who has been prime-signed. 62

61 In the episode referred to from Morkinskinna , he is also the animus in the form of the wise guide to spiritual truth, as his appearance coincides with legal changes in marital affairs governed by the Church at the time of writing; see note 57 above. 62 A Christian ritual, prima signatio , was the act of signing someone with the mark of the cross. This allowed heathens to become Christian initiates who could then take part in Christian social organisation.

RYAN E . JOHNSON

Gestur comes to the king late in the day, tells him his name, and that he requires lodgings. The Odinic wanderer motif appears nested inside a Meleager motif. 63 Gestur is a wanderer who lives 300 years and provides eye-witness accounts of legendary kings to King Ólafur Tryggvason. The Meleager motif sets up Gestur to live his extraordinarily long life. In his own tale, Meleager is visited at birth by the Greek Fates, the Moirai, and they foretell that he shall live as long as a piece of wood in the home fire remains unconsumed. His mother overhears the Moirai and removes the piece of wood from the fire. Parallel to this tale, when Gestur is a baby, he receives a visit by the three Norns, whereupon Skuld decides out of anger with her sisters to curse him. She makes his life the length of a particular candle, instead of the piece of wood that appears in the Greek Meleager tale. At which point, an older Norn who favours Gestur takes the candle, puts it out, and then provides it to his mother for safekeeping. Gestur’s story is somewhat unpropitious in the end, perhaps sacrificial, and the episode includes his own conversion story. He is a weary 300-year-old wanderer, is prime-signed, confers with Ólafur Tryggvason, and with his help, he converts. One day after being taken into Ólafur’s court he made up his mind to die, and he then requested to be anointed, basically receiving a last rites type ritual. The candle was lit and as it faded, so too did the life from Gestur. 64 He received three Christian rites, prima signatio , baptism, and the anointing of the sick. An elf appears during the first night of Gestur’s stay. He is unable to cause harm because, as he says, the place is locked up tight. The lock, however, is symbolic, as the following passage explains: ‘But the elf said this about the lock because Gestr had signed himself with the cross, in the evening, like other men, but was in reality a heathen’. 65 This is a device to move the plot forward since after this event the court becomes curious as to their guest’s background. After Gestur has come and then gone, instead of likening the mysterious character to a king or legendary character as seen elsewhere in Flateyjarbók and Morkinskinna , King Ólafur simply tells his court that he thought Gestur’s words true. When Gestur recounts his tales, the narrative proceeds to use a nested version of the Odinic motif complete with attribution to Óðinn. The tales he tells are of long ago when he accompanied Sigurður the dragon-slayer. The Sigurður in question is the same legendary character found in Völsunga

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

saga . 66 The image given in Gestur’s own words of the wanderer here is especially potent:

Síðan sigldu vér suðr með landi. Þá fengu vér görningaveðr stór […] Síðan sigldu vér nokkuru landhallara. Þá sám vér mann einn á bjargsnös nokkurri, er gekk fram af sjóvarhömrum. Hann var í heklu grænni ok blám brókum ok kneppta skó á fótum, uppháva, ok spjót í hendi.

(Then we sailed south along the coast whereupon we encountered a great uncanny storm […] Then we sailed somewhat closer to shore whereupon we saw a man on a particular crag, as he walked forward on the verge of the sea cliffs. He was wearing a green hooded frock and blue breaches, and nailed shoes coming high up on his legs, and he had a spear in his hand.) 67

The man calls out to them, and in a series of verses he negotiates passage. 68 In the last stanza, the wanderer provides two of his names:

nu mattu kalla karll a biargi Feing edr Fiolni far uil ek þiggia.

(Now you may call the man on the cliff Fengur or Fjölnir. A journey will I accept.) 69

This also appears in stanza 18 of Reginsmál ( The Lay of Regin ) of the Poetic Edda . 70 After he gets on the ship the weather immediately gets better, suggest - ing Óðinn has used magic to bring them towards him. To accentuate this point, Sigurður asks the man to walk out onto the deck of the ship, and then the best of weather greets them. The Odinic motif in the examples from Flateyjarbók , the episodes referred to as ‘Norna-Gests þáttr’ and ‘Halldórs þáttr Snorrasonar goða’, and the episode from Magnús saga góða in Morkinskinna have clearly moved beyond the god- head and into a literary device used to effect awe and wonder on its audience.

The translation is my own. 68 This is an interesting parallel to the eddic poem Hárbarðsljóð . Perhaps this is how one should negotiate passage rather than Þór’s stick-it-in-your-craw type of negotiation. 69 Sigurður Nordal (ed.), Flateyjarbók , vol. 1, p. 390. The translation is my own. 70 ‘Reginsmál’ is a part of the heroic cycle in the Poetic Edda which is related to the narrative found in Völsunga saga ; see Carolyne Larrington (trans.), The Poetic Edda , p. 155.

RYAN E . JOHNSON

Óðinn is depicted as a deception of the devil by the early saga writer, Oddur Snorrason, in the missionary saga of Ólafur Tryggvason. While this facet of Odinic narrative did find its way into other tales in what McKinnell has referred to as the unsympathetic mode, later writings as exemplified by Flateyjarbók , cast the Odinic character in a positive light, going so far as to identify the Christian missionary kings, Ólafur Tryggvason and Ólafur helgi, as the wanderer, rather than Óðinn. 71 Like the Jungian animus , Óðinn can take on either a negative or positive role, similar to how a parent and their advice can be received by a child. In Óðinn’s positive role, his numinous presence provides a reason to follow his advice, though often suspect (e.g., the crew of Hading’s ship in Saxo find the Odinic character’s counsel dubious). In his negative role, his advice is suspect for supposedly good reason (e.g., the evil meat the wanderer tries to get into the food supply in Oddur Snorrason’s tale). 72

‘Norna-Gests þáttr’ is a particularly good example of how the legendary and the kings’ sagas could blend together with the old wanderer motif. The wanderer of this episode tells stories where he is implicated as an actor in legendary narratives. The frame of such episodes in the kings’ sagas is found with the hallmarks of this motif. His image often represents a man who deserves honour, but can sometimes provoke fear or disdain, depending on whether he appears as an adversary or ally. 73 The deceitful Óðinn can also be linked to negative instances of the animus , similar in nature to the French folktale Bluebeard. The image of the wanderer frames the episodes and pro - vides the impression that some type of knowledge is to be imparted. It could be considered numinous knowledge even within a Christian context, as it transcends human understanding by somehow giving the impression of divine substance. This type of understanding can be linked to Jung’s individuation process, the understanding of our world that people struggle to achieve. In stories of legendary kings, it is not uncommon to see Óðinn carrying out a deceitful enterprise, though usually for the betterment of a favoured person, like a parent would do for their child. In the episode of Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks ( The Saga of Hervör and Heiðrekr ) called ‘Gátur Gestumblinda’ (Riddles of Gestumblindi), Óðinn comes to the aid of a rich farmer, Gestumblindi. He is a great enemy of King Heiðrekur and seeks out Óðinn for counsel because he knows he would surely lose to the king in a contest of wits. Óðinn replaces

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

Gestumblindi completely, taking both his name and his form. 74 When introduc - ing the farmer, it is said that he is ‘ekki spekingr mikill’ (no great sage), and so he makes a sacrifice to Óðinn for help, like a child imploring their parent. To prove the wiser, he must seek out a superior. What proceeds when Óðinn travels to the king is the actual riddle contest. Like in Vafþrúðnismál , the contest ends when Óðinn asks the most numinous of questions, one that only he could know: what he had whispered (or will whisper) to his son, Baldur, before his son is to be taken to his funeral pyre. Baldur’s death leads to Ragnarök, the end times of the Old Norse cosmos. But a son’s initiation is signified by death, for it is Baldur who rises again in the golden gilded hall of Gimlé. The time the stories are set in appears to change the Odinic from a quality that only Óðinn can possess to one that can be associated with other characters, as evidenced by the difference between the Eddas along with the legendary sagas on the one hand, and the kings’ sagas along with the Icelandic Family Sagas on the other. Religion does not always appear to play a significant role in choosing to use the motif in relation to missionary Christian kings such as Ólafur helgi and Ólafur Tryggvason, although the Benedictine monk, Oddur, deemed it necessary to cast Óðinn as the devil. 75 Some Christian scribes and editors took a different approach to this motif, creating a more sympathetic role for a character cast in this artistic mode. However, Oddur’s negative rendition melds well with the wise guide to spiritual truth, as his example is intended to show the path of Christian salvation. The shared human psyche, as exemplified by the animus and the centred individual, binds these characters together, as men of action, bearers of the word, as well as the wise guides to spiritual truth, and they can take on negative as well as positive roles in relation to these facets, as can the animus and anima .

The Icelandic Family Sagas

The Icelandic Family Sagas ( Íslendingasögur ) are no exception when it comes to drawing characters with the Odinic motif. 76 An Odinic figure appears in

74 Tolkien (ed. and trans.), The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise , p. 32. 75 The scribe(s) and/or editor(s) of Flateyjarbók also used Oðinn as the devil for Óláfs saga helga ( The Saga of Saint Óláfr ) in ‘Tóka þáttr’ (Tale of Tóki). 76 I wish to thank Anna Katharina Heiniger for allowing me access to her PhD dissertation. In it, she points to two examples of the Odinic motif in the Family Sagas. They are the Loptr/Hallmundr episode from Grettis saga and an episode from Bárðar saga Snæfellsáss ; Anna Katharina Heiniger, ‘On the Threshold: Experiencing Liminality in the Íslendingasögur’ (Unpublished PhD thesis, University of Iceland, 2018).

Grettis saga , a character who changes names from Loptur to Hallmundur, and who lives in a cave near a glacier. He is introduced in the following manner:

Þat var einn dag, at Gettir var jafnan norðr á Dúfunefsskeiði, at hann sá, at maðr reið norðan eptir Kilinum; sá var mikill á baki ok hafði góðan hest ok beizl háseymt, vel tornat; annan hest hafði hann í taumi ok á tǫskur. Þessi maðr hafði síðan hatt á hǫfði ok sá ógløggt í andlit honum. 77

(One day when Grettir was on Dufunefsskeid as usual, he saw a man riding along Kjol from the north. He was a big man, seated on a fine horse with a bridle studded with nails and embossed at the ears. He was leading another horse with bags on it. The man was wearing a wide-brimmed hat which concealed his face.) 78

Grettir tries to attack this man and take his horse, but the man is able to stay Grettir’s hand with great strength. Later, the same entity helps him in an attack that is made against him, and he appears the stronger of the two. Grettir killed six men and he killed twelve. They go back to the strange man’s cave and his beautiful daughter mends their wounds. In these episodes, the Odinic fits the wholly physical man in addition to the man of action. This is a fitting opposition for the character of Grettir hinn sterki (the Strong). The Odinic character asserts his dominance over Grettir by overmatching him in the most recognizable way to the character at hand. Additionally, the troll-like characters that appear as descendants of Óðinn represent, as a group, the aspect of the wholly physical man in relation to the concept of the animus , in contrast with the Norwegian kings that more often reflect the wise guide to spiritual truth. The legendary bleeds into the Icelandic Family Sagas when these types of characters, who are descendants of legendary characters, become protagonists. Egill Skalla-Grímsson is one of these protagonists, having an ancestry that traces back to the legendary trolls called the Hrafnistumenn. 79 Jan de Vries calls attention to the one-eyed artistic mode of the god and the connections this has to Egill Skalla-Grímsson in Old Icelandic saga telling and Irish fables of Cúchulainn. It seems that for this simple artistic motif the story is much older, as de Vries says that this is no borrowing between the Germanic and

THE ODINIC MOTIF : THE WANDERER IN THE MIST

Celtic tribes, but rather that the tradition goes back to Indo-European times. 80

Both Egill and Grettir are characters linked to trolls, a facet of their sagas which also provides a link with an ancient line of peoples. These troll-like characters of the Icelandic Family Sagas are representative of earlier ways and ancient lines of descent. They are children touched by the greatness of their ancient forefathers, though often morally dubious in nature.

Conclusion: The Senex and the Shared Human Psyche

Eddic poetry portrays Óðinn as a seeker of knowledge and a provider of counsel, but also as a punisher of those who do not follow his counsel, like a strict parental figure. Legendary narrative provides a similar character, one who appears mysteriously, provides some necessity, and vanishes. The Odinic descriptions provided by legendary sagas bleed into the kings’ sagas in ‘Norna- Gests þáttr’, where the Odinic character explicitly becomes Christian. Óðinn is, on the other hand, equated with the devil by Oddur munkur Snorrason. His version of Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar is very different from that provided by the Norna-Gestur narrative found in Flateyjarbók , a later work. 81 Óðinn can be seen in this literature as the man of action, the wise bearer of the word, and the wise guide to spiritual truth, and in narratives of troll-like men in the Icelandic Family Sagas as the wholly physical man. This character depiction survived as a modern character type in Gunnar Gunnarsson’s novel, Guest the One-Eyed , and as a modern reinterpretation of the god in Neil Gaiman’s American Gods . In contrast, like Tolkien’s Gandalf, the character depiction is used in modern fantasy under the guise of medieval narrative. There is a power to this motif that is unspeakable, the motif itself is numi - nous in its representation, providing a divine gateway to a spiritual father. From the physical description to the deception and the knowledge provided, the character is shrouded in mystery and evokes a strong sense of awe and wonder. The space between ‘the man of action’ and the ‘wise guide to spiritual

truth’ is a place of movement, maturation, and initiation. The human psyche matures from one haunted by conflicting notions to one who has found a balance between the two, becoming the centred individual. It is little wonder that the motif of this character type is pervasive in literature throughout time, as it touches upon not one but several archetypes of the human psyche.
