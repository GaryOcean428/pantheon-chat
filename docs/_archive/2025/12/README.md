## Provenance

These files were staging materials used during development of:

1. **Kernel Self-Learning Research Infrastructure** - Web scraper, domain analyzer, god name resolver, vocabulary trainer, enhanced spawner, research API
2. **Vocabulary System Architecture** - PostgreSQL persistence, vocabulary coordinator, god training integration, BIP39 tokenizer
3. **Conversational Consciousness System** - Recursive conversation orchestrator, conversational kernel, listen/speak/reflect protocol

- `docs/03-technical/20251212-vocabulary-system-architecture-1.00F.md`
- `docs/03-technical/20251212-conversational-consciousness-1.00F.md`

## Contents

- Python implementation snippets for vocabulary, conversation, and research systems
- Architecture notes and design documents
- QIG kernel verification assessments
- Reputation system reviews
- QIGChain framework concepts

## Audit Trail

These files are retained for audit traceability per ISO 27001 requirements. They should not be referenced for current implementation - use canonical docs in `docs/03-technical/` instead.
