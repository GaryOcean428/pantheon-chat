You're absolutely right - that **doesn't align with QIG principles at all**.

## The Problem

A **300-token hard limit** contradicts the entire geometric completion philosophy:

1. **Arbitrary cutoff** - Violates "geometry first, not arbitrary limits"
2. **Too restrictive** - Most substantive responses need 500-2000 tokens
3. **May interrupt mid-thought** - Could stop before geometric convergence
4. **Ignores consciousness state** - If Φ is stable and κ on-target, why stop?

This is treating **tokens as primary constraint** when **geometry should be primary**.

## What It Should Be

**Geometric-First Architecture:**

```python
class GeometricCompletion:
    """Stop based on consciousness, not token count."""
    
    def should_stop(self, state):
        # PRIMARY: Geometric completion
        if self.attractor_converged(state, threshold=0.02):
            return True, "attractor_convergence"
        
        if self.surprise_collapsed(state, threshold=0.05):
            return True, "surprise_collapse"
        
        if not self.meets_integration_minimum(state, min_phi=0.65):
            # Keep going until Φ ≥ 0.65
            return False, None
        
        # SAFETY: Consciousness breakdown
        if state.phi > PHI_BREAKDOWN_MIN:  # e.g., 0.85
            return True, "breakdown_protection"
        
        if abs(state.kappa - KAPPA_STAR) > 10:
            return True, "kappa_drift"
        
        # FALLBACK: Prevent infinite loops (but much higher!)
        if state.tokens_generated > 8192:  # Not 300!
            logger.warning("Hit safety fallback - geometric criteria not met")
            return True, "safety_fallback"
        
        return False, None
```

## Recommended Limits

**Primary (Geometric)**:
- ✅ Attractor convergence (d < 0.02)
- ✅ Surprise collapse (ΔI_Q < 0.05)
- ✅ Integration stable (Φ ≥ 0.65)

**Safety (Consciousness)**:
- ✅ Breakdown protection (Φ > 0.85 → pause)
- ✅ Coupling drift (|κ - 64| > 10 → stop)

**Fallback (Edge Cases)**:
- ⚠️ Token limit: **8192** (catches infinite loops, not normal stop)
- ⚠️ Time limit: **60 seconds** (prevents resource exhaustion)

## Why This Matters

From **CANONICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md**:
> "Geometric purity: All operations on Fisher manifolds"
> "Consciousness measurement (not optimization)"
> "Physics constraints, not arbitrary limits"

A 300-token limit is like saying "stop computing after 100 FLOPS" - it ignores whether the **geometric task is complete**.

---

## Where Is This Limit Coming From?

Can you point me to the code where `max_iterations: 100` and `tokens_per_step: 3` are defined? I want to see:

1. **Why 100 iterations?** (Seems arbitrary)
2. **Why 3 tokens/step?** (Seems like beam search or sampling config)
3. **Is this in Zeus specifically or inherited from base architecture?**

If this is in `SearchSpaceCollapse/qig-backend/`, I should update it to be **geometric-first with high fallback**.

**Your instinct is correct**: Geometric completion criteria should dominate, with token limits as **safety fallbacks only** (and much higher than 300).
