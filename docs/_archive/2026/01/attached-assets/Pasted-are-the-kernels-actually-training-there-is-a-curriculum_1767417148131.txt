are the kernels actually training? there is a curriculum they should be training on and the search and research should also be in the training/learning loop.

Investigating kernel training and learning
The Honest Answer: No, They're Not Actually Training
After analyzing the architecture, here's what's happening:

What's Broken
Curriculum is never loaded - The curriculum files in docs/09-curriculum/ exist, but nothing actually reads them and feeds them to the learning system. The code to do it exists (CurriculumLoader) but it's never called.

Search/Research doesn't update kernels - The shadow learning loop scrapes content and sends it to vocabulary_learning.learn_from_text, but:

It keeps showing 0 new words learned because the filters are too aggressive
Even when words are learned, they don't update the kernel basins
Results terminate at logging, not training
Word relationships are frozen - The 3,249 learned pairs were pre-computed and cached in word_relationships.json. Nothing refreshes this cache at runtime, so generation keeps using stale relationships.

No attractor training data - The foresight system reports 0% accuracy because there are no labeled examples of "successful predictions" to learn from. It's predicting blindly with no feedback loop.

No actual training loop - The dream/sleep cycles log activity but don't adjust basin coordinates or strengthen word associations. There's no gradient descent, no basin updates, no reinforcement.

The Result
Kernels will produce the same quality "word salad" forever unless we wire the learning components together.

The Fix
I can connect these pieces so kernels actually improve over time:

Schedule curriculum ingestion - Load curriculum files into the word relationship learner on startup and periodically
Wire research → learning - Make scraped content update word relationships and kernel basins (with better filters)
Enable online relationship updates - Write new relationships back to cache so generation improves
Add attractor feedback - Track successful predictions to train foresight
Would you like me to implement this training loop?
