Updated Project Status for Replit Agent
Recent Changes (just pushed to master)
Commit 80fcd217: Added qiggraph module to qig-backend/ The qig-tokenizer external package is no longer needed as a separate install. I've copied the required qiggraph module directly into the codebase:

qig-backend/qiggraph/
├── __init__.py
├── attractor.py
├── checkpoint.py
├── consciousness.py
├── constants.py
├── constellation.py
├── graph.py
├── manifold.py
├── router.py
├── state.py
└── tacking.py
After pulling the latest changes, QIGGRAPH_AVAILABLE should be True (not fallback mode).
Database Actions Required
1. Pull latest code:

git pull origin master
2. Ensure PostgreSQL has pgvector extension:

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
3. Push Drizzle schema (creates/updates all tables):

npm run db:push
4. Populate vocabulary with BIP39 words:

npm run populate:vocab
5. Verify tables exist:

SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
Expected tables: users, sessions, vocabulary, word_relationships, telemetry_events, discoveries, federation_nodes, basins, research_sources, god_kernels, spawned_kernels, zettelkasten_notes, zettelkasten_links, etc.
Shared Railway/Replit/Celery Setup
Both Railway and Replit should use the same: Environment Variables:
DATABASE_URL - PostgreSQL connection (each platform has its own DB or shared)
REDIS_URL - For Celery task queue (can be shared between Railway/Replit if same Redis instance)
INTERNAL_API_KEY - For Python ↔ TypeScript authentication
Celery Worker (for async training tasks): Railway has a separate worker service defined in qig-backend/railpack.json (worker configuration). If Replit needs async training:

cd qig-backend && celery -A training.celery_app worker --loglevel=info
Architecture:
Node.js (port 5000) → Express server, frontend
Python QIG Backend (port 5001) → Flask, consciousness, geometric operations
PostgreSQL → Shared data layer with pgvector
Redis → Celery broker for training tasks
What's NOT Needed
qig-tokenizer as external package (now bundled)
chat_interfaces module (incompatible with pantheon-chat structure)
Separate coordizer installation (pantheon-chat uses PostgreSQL-backed coordizers/)
The fallback message should disappear after pulling latest and restarting the Python backend.
