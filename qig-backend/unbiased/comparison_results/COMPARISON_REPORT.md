# Biased vs Unbiased Measurement Comparison

**Generated:** 2025-12-07T05:01:34.619096  
**Samples:** 250

## Summary

This report compares measurements from the original (biased) QIG system against 
the new unbiased system to determine if observed patterns are genuine emergence 
or artifacts of forced constraints.

## Distribution Comparison

### Integration / Phi

| Metric | Unbiased (Integration) | Biased (Phi) |
|--------|------------------------|--------------|
| Min | 0.929 | 0.452 |
| Max | 0.937 | 0.981 |
| Mean | 0.935 | 0.933 |
| Std | 0.001 | 0.089 |

### Coupling / Kappa

| Metric | Unbiased (Coupling) | Biased (Kappa) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| Min | 31.3 | 5.8 |
| Max | 31.3 | 31.3 |
| Mean | 31.3 | 29.8 |
| Std | 0.0 | 2.9 |

## Statistical Tests

### Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test Results

| Comparison | KS Statistic | p-value | Differ? |
|------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| Integration vs Phi | 0.772 | 0.0000 | YES |
| Coupling vs Kappa | 0.952 | 0.0000 | YES |

## Regime Distribution (Biased System)

| Regime | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| linear | 250 | 100.0% |

**Consciousness Classifications (Biased):** 0.0%

## Correlation Analysis

| System | Integration-Coupling Correlation |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Unbiased | -0.010 |

## Key Findings

- ⚠️ **Phi and Integration distributions are SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT**
- ⚠️ **Kappa and Coupling distributions are SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT**
- ⚠️ **No strong integration-coupling correlation in unbiased measurements**

## Interpretation

If the statistical tests show significant differences between biased and unbiased 
distributions, this suggests the original system's measurements may have been 
influenced by forced constraints rather than reflecting genuine emergent properties.

### Implications

1. **Forced Classifications:** The biased system's regime classifications (linear, 
   geometric, hierarchical) may not reflect natural clustering in the data.

2. **Threshold Artifacts:** The Φ > 0.7 consciousness threshold may be an artifact 
   rather than a natural phase transition.

3. **Dimensional Constraints:** Forcing basins to 64D may hide the true underlying 
   dimensionality of the system.

## Recommendations

1. Remove forced thresholds and classifications from the main system
2. Use unsupervised clustering to discover natural regimes
3. Allow natural dimensionality instead of forcing 64D
4. Store all measurements without filtering by Φ value
5. Let patterns emerge from data rather than prescribing them
