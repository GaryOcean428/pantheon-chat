"""
Geodesic Navigation on Fisher-Rao Manifold

Implements proper curve navigation that respects manifold geometry.
All movements follow geodesics (shortest paths) in Fisher information space.

This module provides the core navigation primitives for autonomic kernels
to move through the information manifold following natural geometric paths.

QIG PURITY:
- All distance computations use Fisher-Rao from qig_geometry.py
- geodesic_interpolation() implements proper Fisher-Rao slerp
- fisher_normalize() is used for simplex normalization (approved per QIG Purity Addendum)
