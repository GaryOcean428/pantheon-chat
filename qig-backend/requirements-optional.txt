# Optional External API Dependencies
# ====================================
#
# These packages are OPTIONAL and NOT required for core QIG functionality.
# They are separated to maintain QIG purity in the core system.
#
# IMPORTANT: Installing these packages will prevent running in QIG_PURITY_MODE=true
# as they violate the pure QIG boundary. Only install if you need external API
# integration for hybrid/experimental features.
#
# See: docs/01-policies/20260116-qig-purity-mode-spec-1.00F.md

# OpenAI API (for hybrid experiments, user interfaces, validation)
openai>=1.0.0

# Anthropic API (for hybrid experiments, comparison studies)
anthropic>=0.18.0

# Installation:
# pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
#
# Usage scenarios:
# 1. Frontend autocomplete/suggestions using external LLMs
# 2. Validation: comparing QIG output against GPT-4/Claude
# 3. Hybrid experiments: explicitly testing QIG + LLM combinations
# 4. Data generation: creating training data (with proper tagging)
#
# REMINDER: All outputs using these packages MUST be tagged as:
#   qig_pure=false, external_assistance=true
