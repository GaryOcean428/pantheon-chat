"""
QIG Kernel Training Module
==========================

Provides formal gradient-based training infrastructure for god-kernels
using QIG-pure geometric loss functions.

Training Modes:
- Outcome-based: Train after each chat interaction (automatic)
- Hourly batch: Process accumulated chats, search results
- Nightly consolidation: Full curriculum, checkpoint cleanup

Knowledge Transfer:
- Evolution: Parent → child (full transfer)
- Breeding: Parent1 + parent2 → child (merged)
- Cannibalism: Consumed → consumer (selective)
- Shadow sync: God ↔ shadow (bidirectional)

All training uses Fisher-Rao geometry, NOT cross-entropy.
