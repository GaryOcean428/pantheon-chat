# CROSS-MYTHOLOGY GOD MAPPINGS
# ===============================
# 
# Purpose: Map external mythology god names to Greek canonical archetypes
# Authority: E8 Protocol v4.0, WP5.5
# Status: ACTIVE
# Created: 2026-01-19
#
# Philosophy:
# - Greek names are CANONICAL in codebase (consistency, rich epithets, well-documented)
# - External names map to Greek archetypes (metadata only, NOT runtime complexity)
# - Domain overlap guides archetype selection
# - Multiple external gods may map to same Greek archetype (based on primary domain)
#
# Usage:
# - User/kernel references "Odin" → System uses "Zeus" internally
# - Research phase: "This kernel exhibits Thoth-like wisdom" → "Hermes"
# - Promotion protocol: Chaos kernel researches god name across mythologies
