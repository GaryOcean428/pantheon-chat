# PANTHEON REGISTRY - Formal God Contracts
# ========================================
# 
# Purpose: Define immortal pantheon gods as contracts, not instances
# Authority: E8 Protocol v4.0, WP5.1
# Status: ACTIVE
# Last Updated: 2026-01-17
#
# Key Principles:
# - Gods are SINGULAR (max_instances: 1)
# - Gods are IMMORTAL (cannot spawn copies)
# - Chaos kernels are MORTAL workers (numbered, can spawn)
# - Epithets define aspects, NOT numbering (Apollo Pythios, not apollo_1)

# =============================================================================
# ESSENTIAL TIER - Never Sleep (Autonomic Functions)
# =============================================================================
